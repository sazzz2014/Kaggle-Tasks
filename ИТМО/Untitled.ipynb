       " b\"good films are hard to find these days . \\ngreat films are beyond rare . \\nproof of life , russell crowe's one-two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller , is one of those rare gems . \\na taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting , an intelligent script , and masterful directing , together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days , genuine motivation in a story that rings true . \\nconsider the strange coincidence of russell crowe's character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan's character in the film -- all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world . \\ni haven't seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah's masterpiece , the getaway . \\nbut enough with the gossip , let's get to the review . \\nthe film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman ( david morse ) , an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti-government soldiers . \\nupon discovering his identity , the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $6 million . \\nthe only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off , and no one will step forward with the money . \\nwith no choice available to her , bowman's wife alice ( ryan ) hires terry thorne ( crowe ) , a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative , to arrange the return of her husband . \\nbut when things go wrong -- as they always do in these situations -- terry and his team ( which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year : david caruso ) take matters into their own hands . \\nthe film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character-driven vehicle filled with well-written dialogue , shades of motivation , and convincing acting by all the actors . \\nthe script is based on both a book ( the long march to freedom ) and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap/ransom situations , and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy , screenwriter of the devil's advocate and dolores claiborne . \\nthe biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan , but that between crowe and david caruso . \\ndug out from b-movie hell , caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe's right hand gun while providing most of the film's humor . \\nryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes , david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him , and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic , gunslinger character of terry thorne . \\nthe most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes . \\nthe bulk of those scenes , which bookend the movie , work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story's characters . \\nthe scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise . \\ndirector taylor hackford mixes both his old-school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film . \\nproof of life is a thinking man's action movie . \\nit is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war , and the sacrifices one makes for those choices -- the sacrifices that help you sleep at night . \\n\",\n",
       " b\"quaid stars as a man who has taken up the proffesion of dragonslayer after he feels he is betrayed by a dragon early in the movie . \\nhe runs into the last dragon in existence , and there is a genuinely amusing battle between the two which results in a standoff where quaid is in the dragons mouth , but has his sword pointed at the dragons brain . \\neventually , they decide to call a truce , and they work out a deal . \\nsince he is the last dragon , he will pretend to die and quaid will be able to get paid for it . \\ntheir scam works at first , until they come to a town without any money . \\ninstead the town sacrifices a girl to the dragon , but of course , draco is a nice droagon , so he won't eat her . there is however a very amusing scene where draco is hitting on the young girl . \\nof course , as you can probably tell by the plot , this is a silly movie , but it does know when to take itself seriously at the right times , unlike eddie , which was serious all the time . \\nyou could probably call this a medieval comedy , because there are more laughs here than in eddie and spy hard combined . \\ndennis quaid makes a fine hero . \\npete posthlewaite provides some ghreat comedy as a monk who journeys with them . \\ndina meyer is appealing as the sacrificed girl . \\nbut lets face it , the movie is really about the dragon , and what an amazing creation he is . \\nconnery's voice and ilm team up to provide us with a truly magnificent dragon . \\nso , if you are going to see this movie for a strong hard core medieval epic , you are going to the wrong movie . \\nif you are going because of the dragon , you will not be dissapointed , and you will be provided with plenty of laughs that smooth out the boring parts in the script . \\n\",\n",

old-fashioned , bland , and outdated . \\n \" the gift , \" directed by sam raimi , is a tried-and-true effort that surprises very little , and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings , to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front , to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond . \\nit\\'s fairly obvious who the killer is ; in fact , i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions . \\nthe film ultimately shouldn\\'t work , but it does , thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances , the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other . \\nannie wilson ( cate blanchett ) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown . \\nsome of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale ( hilary swank ) , who is severely abused by her husband donnie ( keanu reeves ) , and buddy cole ( giovanni ribisi ) , an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he\\'s been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father . \\nfor annie , she does not give the readings merely for money , but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone\\'s future . \\nher late grandmother ( rosemary harris ) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given , and she should always remember that . \\nwhen annie\\'s eldest son is involved in a fight at school , she meets the nice-guy school principal , wayne collins ( greg kinnear ) , whom she finds herself attracted to . \\nbut wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king ( katie holmes ) , whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about . \\nat a party with her best friend linda ( kim dickens ) , annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan ( gary cole ) . \\nsoon after , jessica has disappeared , leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her , and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale , and the pond behind his home . \\n \" the gift \" may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level , but the performances and tight direction from raimi ( who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film , 1999\\'s \" for love of the game \" ) lift the picture up several notches . \\nslowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights , the disappearance of jessica at the 30-minute mark divulges the movie\\'s true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut , at times frightening , horror-mystery . \\nat the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett ( 1999\\'s \" the talented mr . ripley \" ) , who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run-of-the-mill protagonist into a very exact , down-to-earth , realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her . \\nblanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it , giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had . \\nwe follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing , both as a character and an actress . \\nblanchett isn\\'t the only bright performer , as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year . \\nin her first role following her oscar win for 1999\\'s \" boys don\\'t cry , \" hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie , who seeks guidance from annie , but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all : to leave the grossly abusive donnie . \\nas donnie , keanu reeves ( 2000\\'s \" the watcher \" ) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie , so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all . \\nfor the often-criticized reeves , whose acting abilities have never been the best , this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get , and it is also one of the better performances he has given . \\ngiovanni ribisi ( 2000\\'s \" the boiler room \" ) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend , and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad . \\nin the small , but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king , katie holmes ( 2000\\'s \" wonder boys \" ) has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn . \\nher promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before , and she is radiant in her few scenes . \\nfinally , kim dickens ( 2000\\'s \" hollow man \" ) makes her usual strong impression as annie\\'s spicy best friend , linda . \\nthe other notable aspect of \" the gift \" is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it\\'s almost suffocating . \\nthanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski , and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young , the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent , but one that is filled with dread . \\nhelped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson , which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast , \" the gift \" is that rarest of thrillers that actually

       " b\"what i look for in a movie is not necessarily perfection . \\nsometimes a movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have , i will prefer it to a better-made film that is not as thought-provoking . \\nthe thin red line is flawed but it provokes . \\nterence malick returns to filmmaking 20 years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war . \\nunlike this year's saving private ryan , which dwells on war as a necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof , the thin red line simply says war is waste . \\nwhile that might seem obvious to some , only after experiencing the film do you realize how profound a waste it is . \\nsaving private ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur and it has a great cost ; the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs . \\none message is not necessarily more correct than the other . \\nit just depends on one's point of view . \\nin malick's film , war is set in a tropical paradise , and john toll's cinematography is beyond lush . \\nthe setting poses the question , why are we fighting in the face of such beauty ? \\nin saving private ryan , the capture of a german soldier presents the moral quandary of whether to let him go . \\nin the thin red line , the japanese present the moral quandary of war in the first place . \\nthey are just like the americans -- frightened and angry , grieving and praying . \\nall that separates them is war . \\nthe flaw in the thin red line comes in the voice-overs . \\nunbelievable as coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious , sometimes corny , the voice-overs tell us what the images before us already do and are completely unnecessary . \\ndispensing with them , malick could have achieved a tarkovskian grandeur . \\ninstead , he gets distracting self-consciousness . \\naside from that , malick's direction is stunning . \\nthe tracking shots across windswept hills and around transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary . \\nsean penn , elias koteas , and nick nolte give the best performances . \\npenn is subtle as a sergeant trying to hide his humanism , koteas is genuine as a compassionate captain , and nolte startling as a colonel whose blood vessels are about to burst if he cannot win his battle . \\njohn travolta and george clooney are the worst in cameo roles . \\nultimately however , the thin red line's interest is not in the characters and it is not in drama . \\nit has been frequently criticized for its lack of dramatic structure , but malick clearly has different things on his mind . \\nhas no one ever thought that getting dramatic entertainment from war is exploitative ? \\nwhat malick is working with is theme , and in that , the thin red line is most provoking . \\n\",\n",

       " b'bill condon\\'s \" gods and monsters \" is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ( ian mckellan ) , who made the horror classics \" frankenstein \" and \" bride of frankenstein . \" \\nsince i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film , there is no way to know how accurate the film is , but i suspect that much of it only came from whale\\'s inner fantasies and hallucinations . \\nwhale , who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures , decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him . \\nas the film tells it , during the end of his life , whale , at his large home in l . a . , became infatuated with the tall , handsome , and much younger man , clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) , who was working as the gardener at his home . \\njames whale , we learn quickly was , what many people refer to him as in the film , \" a dirty old man . \" \\nin one of the opening scenes , a young film enthusiast visits whale\\'s home to interview him and whale agrees , on one condition : for every question he answers , the young man must take off an article of clothing . \\nbecause of this episode , we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting , later making the excuse that his bright , white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off . \\nclayon agrees , and doesn\\'t really think much of this , much to the warnings of his friends , becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past . \\ncertainly , the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall , since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man , even though boone is not gay , and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life , as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis . \\n \" gods and monsters \" is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast , due to his sexual preference , and never got the recognition he would have liked , since he longed to be referred to as a \" motion picture director , \" rather than a \" horror director . \" \\nand in one heartbreaking scene , he attends a party with boone being his guest , held by director george cuckor , and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore . \\nit is evident that whale\\'s first love in his life was making movies , and when his career ultimately fell apart , so did his passion in life . \\nas played brilliantly by ian mckellen , james whale comes off as a sad , but dignified man , and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others , just as long as he knew he was being true to himself . \\nhe never hid the fact that he was gay , however , even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession , and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person . \\nthrough the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone , boone , of course , only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to , while it means so much more to whale , who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life . \\nalthough boone is only in a dead-end job as a gardener of people\\'s homes , whale views him as the ideal man , not only one that is good-looking , even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings , but one that will actually listen to him . \\nsince whale lives with only his loyal , but disapproving maid ( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave ) , it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world , and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor . \\nalthough an extremely fine and mature picture , a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness . \\nit is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments , but it is a little thin , and the structuring of the \" on-again-off-again \" friendship at the film\\'s center is fairly predictable . \\nwe know early on where these two characters are headed , and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds . \\nin lesser hands , this set-up might have felt too calculated , but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this . \\nalso , a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar ( effectively played by lolita davidovich ) , but abruptly dropped and never brought up again . \\nif the film was not going to follow up on this side story , then it , perhaps , should have been taken out altogether . \\n \" gods and monsters \" is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture , impressively directed by bill condon , who , i sense , relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone . \\nthe film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end . \\nwalking away from \" gods and monsters , \" it was ian mckellen\\'s marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me , and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably . \\nit is a sad testament when a person\\'s true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them , based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life , which , ironically enough , is no one else\\'s business in the first place . \\n',\n",

       " b\"accepting his oscar as producer of this year's best picture winner , saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over . \\none could almost say the same about his much-prized film . \\nrarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling , all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth . \\nin short , the antithesis of all things hollywood . \\nyet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind . \\nralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film . \\nbut despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him . \\nhis emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld . \\nthe same can easily be said for every other character in the film , of which there are too many . \\njuliette binoche's nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart . \\nat least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her , and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious , disfigured , dying stranger . \\neven this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion , however , that it verges on the comical . \\nwith so many characters enjoying so little screen time , the film's 160 minutes can be taxing . \\nyet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn't help but feel that greatness was in the air . \\nhints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern-day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war . \\nthere is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years . \\nbut ultimately the emotional truths writer-director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed . \\nin the end , i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore . \\nbore is perhaps too strong a word . \\nbut after drinking in the rich production values , the cup remains only slightly over half-full . \\n\",\n",
       " b' \" if there\\'s a beast in men , it meets its match in women , too . \" \\nstarring sarah patterson , angela lansbury , tusse silberg , david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan and angela carter , from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus \\nin recent years , there has been a trend in the field of fantasy : writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale and reclaiming that world , investing it with new life and energy . \\nin modern times , fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased ; they have become trite adventures involving leering witches , friendly dwarves , and cuddly talking animals . \\nbut in their original forms , fairy tales have a dark , wicked edge . \\ncrows tear out the eyes of cinderella\\'s sisters , a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version . \\nhansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven . \\nwriters have become fascinated by the bloodier , morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales , and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots . \\nbefore this trend was in vogue , angela carter--whose stories always have a dark , wicked , subversive edge--had been reinventing fairy tales for years . \\nin the company of wolves , she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood , enlivening it with werewolves , rolls royces , and a visit from satan . \\nthe story is structured as a dream , occurring in the mind of rosaleen ( sarah patterson ) , an adolescent girl about whose \\'real\\' life we learn very little . \\nwithin the dream , there are a number of inset stories , most told by dream-rosaleen\\'s grandmother ( angela lansbury ) , and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing , suggestive ways . \\nthe result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister , contemporary fairy tale . \\ni say \" surprisingly \" because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong . \\nand there are ways in which it does . \\nthe performances are mediocre , except for lansbury\\'s--she finds the right note for the prim , apple-cheeked granny , the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales . \\nthe soundtrack , synth-heavy , reminded me of bad 80s horror movies , as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes . \\nprobably state-of-the-art at the time , they are now laughable . \\nbut jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film : he transcends the poor acting/music/effects and conveys a sense of the fantastic , of otherness . \\none of the problems in adapting full-blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader , rather than being subjected to the \\'realism\\' of the screen . \\npart of me would love to see an adaptation of \\'the lord of the rings , \\' but , on the other hand , i know that any filmmaker\\'s recreation of ents , hobbits , and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind . \\nthis makes jordan\\'s accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me : he imbues the company of wolves with a genuine sense of magic and mystery . \\nthe somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur-reality . \\nthe sunshine is exceptionally warm and abundant . \\nthe nights are quiet and misty and eerie and ghostly . \\nthe peasant village is rustic and cozy , the woods old and hoary . \\nthis archetypal realm is the setting for a smart , subtle , literate script , a script which is as good as you\\'d expect from jordan ( himself an accomplished fiction writer ) and carter . \\nfor carter , the cauldron of story is a witches\\' brew , bubbling over with primal ingredients : mist-shrouded forests , ancient graveyards , virginal girls and wise women , wolves with glowing eyes . \\nshe adeptly blends them all together . \\nthere is a symbolic richness to the film ;

       " b'14 years ago , national lampoon introduced us to a new family - the griswolds . \\nin 1983 , the griswolds embarked on a cross-country journey with the destination of wally world , a world-renowned theme park in california . \\nwe laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured . \\ntwo years later , we watched again as they went to europe , and four years after that , we shared christmas with them . \\nnow , eight more years have passed , and the laughs have done more than die . \\nthey\\'ve been cremated . \\nvegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold , the good intentioned but ill-fated father of two . \\nthe premise is basically the same . \\nclark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation , this time to las vegas . \\nhis wife ellen ( beverly d\\'angelo ) and teenage kids rusty and audrey ( always played by different actors - this time around , by ethan embry and marisol nichols , respectively ) join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick . \\nof course a \" vacation \" movie wouldn\\'t be complete without good ole eddie ( reprised by randy quaid ) , the misfit cousin , showing up at all the wrong times . \\nthere isn\\'t too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it . \\nit\\'s really just a skit movie . \\nthere are a couple of ways to define a skit movie , which is not a real term as far as i know . \\nthe first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours , therefore coming off like a two hour skit . \\nthe second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits , each lasting about five minutes . \\nvegas vacation comes off like the first . \\na good example of the latter would be last year\\'s black sheep . \\nthe problem with this format is that it becomes old fast , and it doesn\\'t really fit into a movie mold . \\nin these cases , a \" plot \" , which is generally very thin , is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags ( i . e . \\nhave a good vegas joke , make a vegas movie ) . \\nsuch is the case with this movie\\'s mini-plots . \\nclark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold\\'s money , ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton ( ! ) , rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage , and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie ( shae d\\'lyn ) as an exotic dancer . \\nthe simple fact is : this movie isn\\'t funny . \\nat first , i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes , but when the movie got rolling , my interest suddenly stopped . \\nchase plays clark griswold really well . \\nhe made the character and he is the character . \\nd\\'angelo , to be quite honest , never was too impressive as ellen , and this movie doesn\\'t show any signs of redemption . \\nas for the two new griswold kids , the word \" blah \" comes to mind . \\nthe \" vacation \" series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters , the simple reason being that there is nothing to them . \\nthey\\'re so generic , you\\'ll expect the credits to read \" girl #1 as audrey griswold \" . \\nvegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor . \\nyes , it\\'s true that vegas vacation isn\\'t even close to being close to being as funny as the others , which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways , but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart . \\nfirst off , why did they leave off the national lampoon\\'s heading on the title ? \\ni couldn\\'t find any reasons why , but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn\\'t want to be associated with such a lame film . \\nthat\\'s saying a lot , especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented : loaded weapon 1 , pcu , etc . if they expected this to be another hit , you would assume they\\'d be proud to tack on the notorious header , but for reasons only we can guess at , like the movie sucking , they didn\\'t . \\nthere is another difference here that makes an obvious impact . \\nthe first three films in the \" vacation \" series were written by john hughes , a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80\\'s including mr . \\nmom , sixteen candles , the breakfast club , weird science , pretty in pink , ferris bueller\\'s day off , planes , trains , and automobiles , and uncle buck . \\nwowzers ! \\nwhat a r ? sum ? ! \\nlooking at the names , you\\'d think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the 1980\\'s . \\nwell that\\'s not all . \\nthis guy also brought us 90\\'s hits including the home alone series , the remake of 101 dalmatians , dennis the menace , and the current flubber . \\nvegas vacation , however , didn\\'t have john hughes behind it , and the loss is very obvious . \\nthis time around , the script is in the hands of elisa bell , whose only credits thus far include four made-for-tv movies . \\nvegas vacation plays very much like one , and it would actually work much better as a made-for-tv sequel . \\nif this sounds like a wild idea , it\\'s not . \\nrevenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies , and they seemed like it . \\nvegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2 : 00 a . m . \\nsunday morning movie , but as a silver screen major motion picture , it\\'s quite out of place . \\nstephen kessler\\'s jejune direction doesn\\'t help things either . \\nhe only makes the film even more tv-movie-ish . \\neach consecutive \" vacation \" movie has suffered a drop in directing power . \\nwe started the series off with harold ramis , who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as co-writing ghostbusters . \\nnot too bad . \\nthen we had national lampoon\\'s european vacation being directed by amy heckerling , who would go on to direct the hits look who\\'s talking and clueless , as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high . \\nlastly we had national lampoon\\'s christmas vacation , directed by jeremiah s . chechik , who went on to direct the charming benny & joon . \\nkessler , so far , has one title under his belt , the short film birch street gym , which received an oscar nomination in 1992 . \\ngranted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film , we can allow for some amateurish quality , but instead we get a movie straight from the text book - boring , bland , and deeply unoriginal . \\nif you loved the \" vacation \" movies , and i know * some * of us did , there still isn\\'t anything here worth seeing . \\nif you loved them , don\\'t ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte . \\nif you never did like the series , why the need to confirm why ?

       " b'on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento\\'s much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with . \\nin emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his \" giallo \" murder mysteries . \\nwhile it\\'s certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller . \\nthe story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book \" tenebrae \" . \\nwith the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems . \\nthe film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa . \\nhe brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him . \\nthe film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension . \\nargento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business . \\ntenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento\\'s scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here . \\nit may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play . \\nin that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes . \\nneedless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director\\'s brilliance as a stylist . \\nmany of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork . \\nthey are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria . \\ninstead , tenebrae\\'s set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world . \\nand the soundtrack\\'s mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment . \\nso tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question . \\nstill , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative . \\nsome critics argue that logic doesn\\'t matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don\\'t deserve to feel cheated . \\nby the way , if you don\\'t want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs . \\nabout an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious . \\nwe witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal . \\nhe is insane , apparently . \\nthe murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it\\'s time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife . \\nhe is finally revealed to us as this \" second killer \" in the film\\'s bloody climax . \\nbut argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively . \\nyou see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer\\'s house . \\nbut thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway . \\nbad cutting puts the timing way out . \\nin other words , he\\'s almost in two places at once . \\nduring this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring . \\nby the film\\'s end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant . \\nthe injury ? \\nhe banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! \\nthus , the revelation of the \" hero \" as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled . \\nhelpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along . \\nbut there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least . \\nthe story owes us a better understanding of franciosa\\'s mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage . \\ntenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies . \\nfor instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike . \\nwe would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren\\'t even introduced too ! \\nthat\\'s careless filmmaking , pure and simple . \\nwhy , you may ask , do i go on about the story\\'s flaws ? \\nbecause when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world . \\ntake one of the extended scenes in tenebrae . \\nan upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town . \\nfinally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer\\'s lair . \\nit\\'s an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone . \\nand that\\'s exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating . \\ntoo often , it seems , argento\\'s films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts . \\nmind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look . \\nand if you\\'re a fan of argento\\'s unique style of giallo thriller then it\\'s essential . \\nsee the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli . \\nit\\'s a stylish , great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative . \\na shame , because it doesn\\'t have to be that way . \\ntake argento\\'s more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache . \\nproof that he can do it , if he tries . . . \\n',\n",

) , his girlfriend from before prison . \\nshe\\'s a goregeous ballerina , and a stripper , and soon carlito is trying to get back with her , and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami . \\nwhile this relationship is never fully defined or anything , we get a sense of love between them , and they have some truly interesting scenes between them ( she never gives him addresses or locales - he always has to track her down ) . \\nall of these elements clash together at the end , in a brilliantly executed , emotional climax , which is inevitable . \\nwhen i say inevitable , i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack , putting a great spin on it . \\nsure , it\\'s going to eleveate some of the tension , but it gives the film a lot of depth , as carlito is seen trapped by fate . \\nwhat\\'s amazing is the big chase sequence ( amazingly done by de palma ) has a lot of tension and thrills . \\nlike \" apollo 13 , \" we know what\\'s going to happen , but we\\'re still thrilled by what happens in the middle . \\nit\\'s also very emotional , thanks to a great script by david koepp , and amazing performances by pacino and miller . \\nde palma is famous ( or infamous ) for lots of violence in his films . \\nhis earlier flim , \" scarface \" ( which starred pacino in the lead ) , has a ton of it , especially at the end ( and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i\\'m still not over ) . \\nbut de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes . \\nto me , the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building , looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet . \\nthis is the most brilliantly done , and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film , and probably the best in de palma film history . \\nwith a gorgeous soprano duet in the background , and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito\\'s head , and a saddened , remorseful look on pacino\\'s face , it\\'s a tear-jerker ( well , for me , i dunno about you . . . ) . \\nthe acting from all is great , especially from the three leads . \\npacino was panned for his performance , chiefly because his accent wasn\\'t puerto rican enough and , well , it wasn\\'t as \" strong \" as his oscar-winning role in \" scent of a woman . \" \\nwell , his \" scent of a woman \" performance was great and all , but it was nothing really but , as comic kevin pollack said , a \" foghorn leghorn impression . \" \\nin \" carlito\\'s way , \" he\\'s emotional , and strong , despite the fact that he\\'s remorseful over his entire lifestyle , which he cannot change . \\ni felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tango-dancing , insult-throwing blind guy in \" scent of a woman . \" \\nas i said , penelope ann miller is great , and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry . \\nand they\\'re scenes are well-written , with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship . \\nand sean penn is amazing as the coke-addicted rat attorney . \\nevery scene he\\'s in , he has great energy , and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino . \\nin smaller roles , john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great . \\n \" carlito\\'s way \" is one of those films which you heard about briefly , but when you finally watch it , you\\'re absolutely blown away . \\nit\\'s a wonderful film , a highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved after it didn\\'t do so hot . \\nbut trust me and check it out . \\nit\\'s a great little film , and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are not always right . \\n',\n",

       " b' \" mandingo \" has traditionally been seen as one of two things : either a much-needed revisionist look at slavery in the south , or in the words of film critic leonard maltin , \" a trashy potboiler \" that \" appeals only to the s&m crowd . \" \\nactually , i think \" mandingo \" is a strange combination of the two , although it fails on both fronts . \\nit\\'s too trashy to be good drama , but too dramatic to be good trash . \\nthe story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell ( james mason ) and his son , hammond ( perry king ) . \\none day in new orleans , hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede ( heavyweight boxer ken norton ) . \\nalthough the movie never explains it , a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley . \\naccording to the movie , mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves . \\nhammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him . \\nhammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves . \\nmeanwhile , hammond has married his cousin , blanche ( susan george ) , because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild . \\nhammond , however , is happier spending nights with his \" bed wench , \" the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex . \\nit is quickly apparent that hammond , despite his overt racism , is more in love with his bed wench , a sensitive slave girl named ellen ( brenda sykes ) , than he is with blanche . \\nhammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had \" pleasured \" her before he did . \\nof course , it\\'s fine that he\\'s slept with numerous slave girls , but the fact that his wife , a \" white lady , \" had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her . \\nso blanche is usually left lonely and sex-starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen . \\nblanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child . \\nhammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half-black child ( although it\\'s okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond ) , so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth , and hammond poisons blanche . \\nhammond then finds mede , shoots him twice in the shoulder , and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water . \\nyes , you read right : the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive . \\njudging only by the plot , \" mandingo \" is pure sexploitation . \\nthe main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible , with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society . \\nwhen \" mandingo \" was released in 1975 , it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail ; this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs . \\ndramatically , \" mandingo \" is weak and unfocused , and historically it\\'s mostly confused . \\nif one were to judge history by this film , it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality , not economics . \\nnot once in the film do we see any of the slaves working , except for a few house servants . \\nthe men spend most of the time sitting around , while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner . \\nthere is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves , but \" mandingo\\'s \" overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick ( although there\\'s plenty of violence -- fights , vicious beatings , shootings , and the aforementioned human boiling sequence -- thrown in for good measure ) . \\nsome tried to write off \" mandingo \" as a blaxploitation film , one of a number of quickly-made , low-budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies , but it\\'s not that easy . \\n \" mandingo \" was studio-financed by paramount pictures , and produced by dino de laurentiis , the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as \" the bible \" ( 1966 ) , the remake of \" king kong \" ( 1976 ) , and the ill-fated \" dune \" ( 1984 ) . \\nthe director was richard fleischer , a veteran who was best known for several special effects-laden action movies including \" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea \" ( 1954 ) and \" fantastic voyage \" ( 1966 ) , as well as such superior suspense films as \" the narrow margin \" ( 1952 ) . \\nthe script , based on the supermarket best-seller by ken ostott ( and the subsequent play by jack kirkland ) , was penned by norman wexler , who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on \" serpico . \" \\njames mason , perry king , and susan george were well-known and respected actors ( mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt ) , and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career . \\nso why is \" mandingo \" so bad ? \\na number of reasons , including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job . \\nwexler\\'s script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive ; it combines stereotyped slave-talk ( \" yessuh , massuh \" ) , stereotyped southern white trash talk ( \" fer whut\\'re you gittin\\' outta bed ? \" ) , and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk ( \" if you see me hang , you gonna know you killed a black brother ! \" ) . \\nfleischer\\'s direction is clumsy , especially during the fight scenes , and all the actors give weak performances , especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable . \\nnevertheless , credit should be given where credit is due . \\ndespite its exploitative nature , \" mandingo \" was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery . \\nuntil then , there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery . \\neven classics such as \" gone with the wind \" ( 1939 ) can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter . \\n \" mandingo \" reassessed the south , and showed that it wasn\\'t all beautiful plantations , green fields , and pretty sunsets . \\nbut all this is constantly undermined by the film\\'s negligible point-of-view -- it claims to see things from the black perspective , but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners . \\nwith a little more maturity and different handling , \" mandingo \" might have been an effective , worthwhile film . \\nwhile it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery , it never deals with them . \\nthe issues the movie brings up are worthwhile , but wexler\\'s script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing . \\nthere is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner , but \" mandingo \" never does it . \\nsteven spielberg touched on that same topic in \" schindler\\'s list \" ( 1993 ) , by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid . \\nthe difference between that film and \" mandingo \" is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair , unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma . \\n \" mandingo \" is satisfied to simply show some skin , and because of that , its \" trashy potboiler \" nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished . \\n',\n",

\\ngo clubbing ! \\nsure , that makes sense . \\narquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking . \\nscenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable . \\neven though frankie page\\'s life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon . \\neven more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances . \\nfather andrew\\'s religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic . \\nas for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , \" i\\'ll get you , my pretty , \" for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded . \\ntrust me , i\\'m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain . \\nwhat\\'s worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible . \\nfirst of all , the film doesn\\'t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ? \\nhow come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ? \\nactually , i\\'m not sure what frankie was posessed by . \\nsupposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) . \\nwhich one is it ? \\nthe answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time . \\nfurthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church . \\nif you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas , you\\'ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library . \\nthere\\'s nothing the catholics need to worry about , though . \\n \" stigmata\\'s \" religion is so off-base that it can\\'t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church . \\nif they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters , they should have gone all-out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns , which would have been far more interesting . \\ni\\'m not catholic ; in fact , i don \\'t care much for the catholic church , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means . \\nit\\'s rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as \" stigmata \" does . \\nit\\' s not thought-provoking , though it would like to be , and it is definitely not scary , though it pretends to be . \\ni\\'m not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story . \\nmaybe it\\'s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever . \\nthe initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over . \\nlike so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill . \\nso much is overdone in \" stigmata , \" that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film\\'s ( many ) flaws . \\ni\\'m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth-shattering . \\nwhen we finally hear it , the saying sounds like something every five-year-old learns on their first day of sunday school , which means that for all its flash , the whole film is really much ado about nothing . \\nthe dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog , and \" stigmata \" is it . \\n',\n",
       " b'reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) . \\nthe guy can\\'t seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : \" rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel \" ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) . \\nhis screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight . \\ni can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , \" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! \" \\nit\\'s almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie . \\nand why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? \\nauteur theory be damned ; it\\'s kruger\\'s \" style \" , not the director\\'s that winds up on screen . \\nkruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut \" sometimes less is more \" . \\nand his numerous twists can\\'t even claim to be originals ; arlington rd\\'s ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol\\' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn\\'t know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the \" character \" . . . grammar \\nbe damned ) . \\n \" how did you know that ? \" \\nthe stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along . \\n . \\n . \\nsince twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger\\'s screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it\\'s no wonder why he works so frequently . \\nhe\\'s quickly becoming miramax\\'s mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects . \\nthis is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles . \\ntheir company\\'s current logo could be \" we ride the trends \" . \\nreindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head . \\nalthough affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick . \\naffleck is such a puppy dog that it\\'s impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone\\'s bitch . \\nthe role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent \" serious \" movie getting . \\nit may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who\\'s played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) \\njames frain is nick , rudy\\'s cellmate , a manslaughterer who\\'s found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) . \\nashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she\\'s never seen one picture of him . \\nwhich works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley\\'s brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts . \\nhe plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino . \\nthough by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i\\'ve described might as well be irrelevant . \\nthis is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner . \\nincluded : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) . \\nthough it\\'s an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience . \\nthe flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up . \\nit would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau \\n ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this . \\nhe films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart . \\nproblem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play . \\ncharacter problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off . \\nthe former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear . \\nbut then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster . \\ncharlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next . \\nshe never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this . \\ngary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat . \\nthese are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience . \\n',\n",

       " b\"the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king's work . \\nthis slow-moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals , but suffers from a tepid conclusion , inconsistent direction , and may not have wide commercial appeal . \\nwhen the maid , dolores claiborne , is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer , it seems like an open-and-shut murder case . \\nupon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax , dolores' estranged and bitter daughter , esquire magazine writer selena st . george , returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home . \\nas the two clash horns , the story behind the mysterious death of dolores' abusive husband two decades ago , ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey , is revealed . \\ndid dolores kill her husband ? \\nand did she kill her employer ? \\ndolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller . \\nconsequently , it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywood's finest character actors , such as bates , leigh and strathairn . \\nkathy bates plays the film's title character , and gives a sensational lead performance . \\ndolores claiborne is essentially a showcase for the talent of bates , as her character has a huge amount of screen time . \\nshe dominates the screen , producing a character that is compelling and arresting , as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks . \\nkathy bates' performance is award-calibre stuff . \\nthe rest of the cast is also very good . \\njennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour , bitter helena st . george well , and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores' ever-present nemesis , the determined detective john mackey . \\ndavid strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores' husband , joe st . george . \\njudy parfitt is fine as dolores' tyrannic socialite employer , vera donovan--it would have been interesting to see , say , meg foster in this role . \\nchild actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences ; she is very impressive . \\nthe direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film , ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their own right , to parts which are embarrassingly hokey . \\nthe segues between flashbacks and the present are very hit-and-miss in terms of effectiveness . \\nthe pacing of the film tends to be numbingly slow , which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up . \\nhowever , the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderful--i particularly like the chilling ice-blue hue permeating the present-day scenes , contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shots--and danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film . \\nit would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited . \\nnone of the performers in the film could be classified as a big draw , and its pacing may be a turn-off to those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists and turns and car crashes and axe-wielding psychopaths . \\nalthough being essentially the only film in its genre in release now , it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works , even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand . \\ndolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion , and moves very slowly . \\nhowever , the performances are uniformly excellent , particularly kathy bates , and the film has its moments . \\non my four-star scale , i give dolores claiborne three stars . \\n\",\n",

       " b'tempe mills cinema , az--this movie had us in non-stop stitches from beginning to end . \\nall those promotional clips that have been on tv for the past month came from the first five minutes of the movie . \\nif you thought they were funny , see the rest of the movie . \\nit\\'s hilarious . \\nhow does one go about making a movie about a couple guys whose only claim to fame is synchronized head-bopping on snl to exactly one song ? \\neasy . \\nwrite an interesting script around tried-and-true ideas , add some good lines and satire , and voil ? , you end up with an excellent , well-done , very entertaining flick . \\nwill and chris are idiot brothers forced by their father to work begrudgingly in the family flower business during the day . \\nat night they pursue their life-long ambition to loose their virginity in failed attempts to get into the roxbury in beverly hills , ca , the only disco act worth going to . \\nthe only problem , the place is so popular and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to the front door , the roxbury closes , all the while bearing witness to guys with one-hundred-dollar bills and movie stars like richard grieco who get past the doorman without fuss . \\nthe script authors ( steve koren , will ferrell and chris kattan ) cleverly devised a way for our boys to get into the roxbury . \\ntheir flower-shop van is rear-ended by richard grieco , who fears a law-suit and is surprised to see the idiots are too star-struck to think about the car accident they just had , but not about getting into the roxbury . \\ngrieco happily takes them in , even introduces them to the owner , which has the added benefit of enhancing the financial appearance of the idiot brothers in the eyes of a couple of gold diggers ( elisa donovan and gigi rice ) who bet their time and bodies on will and chris . \\nwhat follows are some of the best slap-stick dancing routines ever . \\nthe music is superb , and could have only been made better had the producers added patrick hernandez\\'s born to be alive . \\nthe choreography at times was a parody of an era gone by , for example , the bee gees and their stayin\\' alive . \\nit is nostalgic for those of us who remember that far back , and the technique is a clever adaptation that worked well in forest gump . \\none of the funniest scenes is when the gold diggers discover that will \\nand chris don\\'t have any mone y , and dump both on the spot , even expressing violence and anger that they gave sex away . \\nan art-imitates-life poke at shallow women . \\nit\\'s a scene that\\'s an approximate parody of the vinegar\\'s own rolf luedeke\\'s editorial this week national organization for men ( nom ) replaces now . \\nted \" unabomber \" \\nkaczynski , himself rejected for not having money , will identify well with this scene , if he ever watches the movie . \\nof course , the script wouldn\\'t be complicated enough without adding molly shannon , the girl next door who has had a crush on will since they were kids , and who will has had an aversion to in quest of good-looking disco blondes ( proof that men will turn down perfectly good women when there are bay watch babes always lurking nearby ) . \\nnevertheless , will\\'s father wants him to marry molly anyway , but thinks idiot chris is standing in the way and sends him into guest-quarter exile . \\nduring the wedding ceremony , will\\'s heart isn\\'t exactly into getting married , and when his brother appears on the balcony with a ghetto blaster and more head-bopping music , will thinks worse of the knot-tieing idea and runs to chris . \\ndefinitely an snl parody of the graduate where katharine ross changed her mind for the screaming dustin hoffman in the church balcony . \\ni found this scene a riot , however , it went over brandi\\'s head -- she was born seven years after the graduate first appeared . \\nthe scene has a good punch line when molly shannon marries , instead , the step-in buddy/weight-lifter ( who looks like he could pass for the son of gary busy ) and who has been lusting for a good-looker for a long time , but ready now to take anyone . \\nmore art-imitates-life stuff -- not even muscles can substitute for money in the real world . \\nthe idiots\\' mother is played by loni anderson , whose barbie-doll looks \\ndon\\'t play well anymore ( she\\'s a bit old ) , and whose cleavage looks like someone botched a tracheotomy too low down . \\ni recommend this movie for anyone who wants to have a lot of fun or in \\nneed of a lot of laughs . \\ngo with a date . \\nbrandi laughed non-stop , as i \\ndid , and a deaf-mute might have concluded i was tickling her continuously for 105 minutes . \\n',\n",
       " b\"as with his other stateside releases , jackie chan's latest chopsocky vehicle , mr . nice guy , is contrived , blockheaded , and lacking in narrative logic . \\nbut also like those other films , it is a highly enjoyable ride . \\nonce again , chan's screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star's character simply jackie , with no last name . \\nthis jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television . \\nof course , jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist , and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring . \\nother plot details , involving a videotape and a biker gang , are irrelevant ; in fact , as is the case with most chan films , the plot itself is just about irrelevant . \\nthe sole purpose of mr . nice guy's existence are chan's comic fight scenes , and those here do not disappoint . \\ndirector samo hung ( who has a cameo role ) , a longtime collaborator of chan's , does not waste any time putting chan in action , diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue . \\nother impressive set pieces follow , most notably a chase in a mall , which directly leads to some frenzied , if cliched ( can you say fruit cart ? ) , business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site , in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards , cement mixers , and a deadly buzzsaw . \\nnone of the action sequences in mr . nice guy are as spectacular as supercop's thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx's daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor , respectively . \\nbut the action delivers , even if the energy peters out before the film's end ( the finale , as spectacular as it is , is a letdown for fans of chan's athletic prowess ) . \\nfilmed almost entirely in english ( even so , the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed ) , mr . nice guy hints at jackie chan's latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980's the big brawl and 1985's the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour , a stateside production co-starring chris tucker . \\nhopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown , and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr . nice guy , for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands , much like they have been before . \\n\",\n",
       " b\"to me , nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a martin scorsese film . \\ndespite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed , the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence . \\never since the big success of the action-thriller `face/off' in 1997 , the hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr . cage . \\nthe perpetually awful assassination thriller `snake eyes' was one of 1998's worst films . \\n`8mm' was a disappointing lost cause . \\nbut who better than scorsese to match cage's wit and intensity , which he does in miraculous fashion with `bringing out the dead' . \\ncage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce , a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from day-to-day . \\nafter five years of the stress-inducing job , frank basically just staggers onward , relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift finally ends . \\nhe also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care , namely a young girl named rose , who stares back at him with pale features at every street corner in new york . \\nfrank desperately wants to be fired , but his boss needs him to scour the city and help those in need ( `i'll fire you tomorrow . . . ' he promises ) . \\nfrank is accompanied by a fresh face every night in the ambulance . \\nthe first is larry ( john goodman ) , who always has food on the brain . \\nthe second is marcus ( ving rhames ) , a deeply religious black man who incorporates the power of jesus into a regular rescue operation . \\nand finally , tom ( tom sizemore ) is a deranged sociopath hungry for blood . \\ni found it unique how scorsese used each of these characters for a single shift with frank , but they never figured into the actual plot . \\neach is merely a colorful presence to help develop frank's character , because `bringing out the dead' is predominantly a study of his mind and detailed personality . \\nthe one character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary ( patricia arquette ) , the daughter of a newly admitted patient who suffered from a severe heart attack . \\narquette , who recently received the wounds of christ in `stigmata' , performs well around real-life husband cage . \\nit's unfortunate that , after such intriguing character trials and tribulations , the relationship between frank and mary slips during a mishandled , ineffective finale . \\nthe movie belongs to the one-two punch of cage and scorsese , who were born to collaborate their efforts in an arrangement similar to `bringing out the dead' . \\nalthough it certainly lacks the grit and hard-edge of something like `goodfellas' , scorsese manages to hit a nerve with his latest picture . \\nthe incredible camera-work and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration . \\nfans will be pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive , darkly humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with 1997's `kundun' . \\ndoes `bringing out the dead' rival scorsese's finest work ? \\nonly occasionally . \\nsome of the film feels surprisingly limp , but there is enough energy in it's interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice . \\nthose expecting a grisly , risqu ? product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straight-arrow approach - but it's still a solid , admirable effort . \\n`bringing out the dead' was written by the acclaimed paul schrader , who collaborated with scorsese on such classics as `taxi driver' and `raging bull' . \\nschrader's script is full of moments - wonderful , sharply defined moments - that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering screenplay . \\nthe exceptional aspects of the film are it's astounding technical credits and the amazing cast . \\ngoodman and sizemore are both electric ( well , mainly sizemore ) , but it's the phenomenal ving rhames who deserves a second look . \\nwatch the actor's deeply inspired dedication as he resurrects a gothic band member , and you'll understand why he won a golden globe . \\n`bringing out the dead' is raw and electrifying often enough to mask it's certain flaws . \\nscorsese - and cage , for that matter - have done better , but their intentions are certainly admirable . \\n\",\n",
       " b\"review : a dog of flanders is the story of an adorable little boy named nello and his trials and tribulations in 19th century flanders . \\nliving with his grandfather jehan ( jack warden ) in poverty , nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times ( they are renting a spare one-room cottage , and the greedy , malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them `out of the house' if they don't pay the rent ) . \\nnello also has a rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen , in either a movie or in real life . \\n ( his hero is peter paul rubens , the great flemish painter of the 17th century . ) \\nnot that these are the only things that make nello's life happy , however . \\nhe has a dog of flanders , whom he names patrasche , who is a heroic rin-tin-tin of the 19th century , whom he rescues from his cruel , unkind master . \\nin addition , he even has a best friend ( and future sweetheart ) in the lovely , wealthy aloise , whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with `lower-class' nello . \\n ( he thinks he's not good enough for her , and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying . ) \\nbut then , he was a poor guy himself before he married ( as mentioned later on in the film ) . \\none day , nello encounters a mysterious , yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande ( played wonderfully by jon voight ) , who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart , and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an artist . \\nand every christmas , there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year ; the winner getting a lot of money . \\neager to save his home ( and his aging , dying grandfather ) , nello willingly decides to become an artist , asking aloise to pose for him . \\none night , the two travel to a circus , where they have their fortune told ? one of the film's most delightful scenes ? that great happiness is destined for them . \\nshe gives the kids a ring , whom nello places on aloise's hand . \\n ; ) afterwards , the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers . \\nunfortunately , things are not all `la-dee-dah' in this tale . \\naloise's father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again . \\nbad enough that they can't see each other ( although we know nello and aloise , don't we ? ) , but that's only the start of nello's troubles . \\naloise's farm is burned down , and nello is wrongfully accused ( by the landord of his cottage ) for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise . \\nthis decreases nello's reputation around the town , save aloise and her parents , and a kindly miller , william , who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by . \\nmatters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies , and he has to pay for his funeral . \\nbut then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home ( for not paying his rental ) ? permanetly . \\nthis means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold , freezing wind . \\nworst of all , the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time , `the portrait of the princess' , fails to win the prize at the festival . \\nnow nello and patrasche are really depressed , and close to freezing to death . \\nwill nello be able to find any happiness in his life ? \\nwill patrasche save the day ? \\nwill nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise ? \\na dog of flanders is a delightful , heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages . \\neven older ones who consider themselves too `sophisticated' for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grown-ups , too . \\nthere have been other movies of this ilk ( boy and dog ) , and while this one falls into that category , it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties and finding a good home for yourself . \\nmove over ? or rather , roll over ? old yeller , this dog of flanders is a heartwarming delight . \\nthe cinematography , courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful , and really adds to the powerful drama of the film . \\nit also gives a feel of being in flanders ( the whole film was respectably shot in flanders ) . \\nthe music from richard friedman is also remarkable ; an evocative , poignant score that recaptures music from the 19th century . \\nthe opening song over the credits is very beautiful ( i hope the soundtrack is available ! ) , and there's a brief excerpt of `cheer up , charlie' from willy wonka and the chocolate factory ( sung by aloise , to nello , in another delightful scene ) . \\nthe cast is first-rate : jesse james and jeremy james kissner , who play nello , are some of the most endearing , adorable young stars i have ever seen in my whole life ( so are the girls who play aloise , madyline sweeten as the younger , and farren monet as the older ) . \\nnot that they are the only good stars , however . \\njack warden is ideal as jehan , eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character . \\n ( the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming , touching ones . ) \\nalso , bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william . \\nhe's another one of my favorite characters in the film . \\nbut jon voight , as i mentioned before , is the perfect choice for michel . \\nhe brings a mysterious , yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he * can * win the contest . \\nbut what makes this film fun to watch is how well-defined the characters are , and the pace of the story ( best of all , it has a happy ending ? though i will * not * give it away ; sorry ) is strong and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters . \\nfor the first time since the beginning of 1999 , there comes a film which doesn't rely on popular formula stuff , such as big-budget special effects , commercial rock soundtracks , or any of that stuff . \\nthis one relies on telling a fully character-oriented story , with just the right amount of heart , humor , and drama . \\nthat , to me , is what makes a dog of flanders all the more delightful . \\neleanor o'sullivan of `the home news & tribune' noticed this , and was kind and generous enough to welcome it : `for want of a better word , a glow surrounds a dog of flanders . \\nits heart is in the right place and it engages you . \\nyou can guess where the film is going because this is well-traveled territory , but with pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner , an often-told story is well worth a revisit . ' \\nin addition , there were a couple of other enthusiasts , such as chicago-sun times and the washington post ( you should read their reviews ; they're really positive ) . \\nother critics , however , were not so kind . \\nstephen holden of `the new york times' had more than a share of beatings to lay upon a dog of flanders via pen writing . \\nhe found the film to be a `sea of sugary bromides' and condemned mr . voight's character as `hopelessly wooden ? adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up with for anaconda . ' \\nin addition , `entertainment weekly' slam-dunked the film , condemning it as `the worst family film of the year . ' \\nthere have been so many other bad reviews like this , too . \\nmy suggestion : disregard the critics . \\nthey just have a big problem with touching family films , and one should never pay attention to them . \\nthis dog of flanders may only be a little `family' movie ( it probably won't be a big hit in the style of titanic , but then again no other film has been since then ) , but that is not a bad thing in and of itself . \\nthis is a story that is sure to warm your heart , and that is what really matters about a dog of flanders . \\nit is also one of the better family films around this year . \\nnone of the other films i have seen this year ( though they were good ) have been so low-key and touching . \\nif you're looking for family-style entertainment , look no further than this charming boy-and-dog yarn . \\ngo see it while you still can , for as i mentioned , it might not be a big bow-wow at the box office for a long time . \\nsee it while you can . \\nthere is really no need to compare a multi-million dollar blockbuster such as star wars : episode i ? the phantom menace or tarzan , or even the iron giant with a tender , sweet little family movie . \\n\",\n",

       " b'the main problem with martin lawrence\\'s pet project , a thin line between love and hate , like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man , is that his character is an irresponsible jerk , and if that is the case , it doesn\\'t seem to do anything except justify the woman\\'s actions . \\nthat is especially the case in lawrence\\'s darnell wright . \\nhe is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long . \\nnow don\\'t think i condone this just because i\\'m male . \\nmy philosophy is , if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful , kind girl , you should treat her like a princess and respect her . \\ndarnell doesn\\'t think like this . \\nhe sleeps with these girls once and dumps them . \\nand by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target , beautiful , wealthy brandi web ( played nicely by whitfield ) who runs a successful real estate business , is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia ( king ) , i found myself thinking , \" i\\'m supposed to feel sorry for this guy ? \" \\nafter all , it is largely darnell\\'s fault . \\nif he is lining up all these women , you\\'d think he\\'d have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day , as his mother says it does . \\nbut he doesn\\'t , so you get the sense that he\\'s not only irresponsible , but also pretty dumb . \\nyou especially get this sense that he\\'s dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her . \\n ( i\\'d put my pants on in two seconds after that ! ) \\nnow , brandi is a psycho bitch , but it\\'s hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage . \\none final flaw , though , is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with . \\nbrandi is a classy , intelligent woman with an mba from harvard , who initally resists darnell\\'s \" immature play \" as she calls it , as any woman like her would in real life . \\nbut all of a sudden she says yes . \\nbut when you listen to darnell\\'s four letter word vocabulary watch his actions , you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period , much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him ! \\nlawrence can be good when he wants to , but in order to prove it , he needs to let other people write and direct his movies . \\nlook at this movie . \\nfour writers , as a result it\\'s too long ( two hours , when it could\\'ve easily worked at ninety minutes ! ) and it has a lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came ( which makes me think the writers didn\\'t get along ) , all of which isn\\'t necessary . \\nthere are some bright spots , though . \\nwhitfield , regina king , della reese , and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts , and they help it out a lot . \\nand there are some funny parts ( like , for example , the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property ) , but they\\'re just not enough to sustain the film . \\n',\n",
       " b\"the plot of big momma's house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . \\nthat's not just the high-concept premise ; it's the fully-realized , all-encompassing plot . \\nsuch an emphasis is not unheard-of in the world of hollywood summer entertainment . \\none need merely look back to last summer , when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent . \\nthe trap inherent in such an approach is that the high-concept plot idea better be pretty well-realized , or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer , because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time -- not a developed character , not a provocative theme , not a witty twist . \\nyou will get 90-plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress -- nothing more , nothing less . \\nthose who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the one-note dud that is big momma's house . \\nothers will simply stare , mouth agape , at its sheer unapologetic laziness . \\nlawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner , an undercover expert on a stakeout assignment with his partner john ( paul giamatti ) . \\ndangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco ( terrence howard ) has escaped from prison , and the feds think he's headed for his former girlfriend and presumed-but-never-proved accomplice sherry ( nia long ) . \\nsherry , however , has fled with her son trent ( jascha washington ) , possibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae ( ella mitchell ) , better known as big momma . \\nindeed , sherry appears to be on her way , but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming . \\nthat leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows . \\nbig momma's house's bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs . \\ndoubtfire -- director raja gosnell edited that film , and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom -- but there's just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main character's attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman . \\nunfortunately , big momma's house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made : instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses , it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters . \\nsuspension of disbelief in big momma's house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind and/or stupid , since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other . \\nof course , laughs trumps logic every time , and big momma's house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny . \\nand it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foul-tempered beast , while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry . \\nunfortunately , no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another , very different real person , so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags : malcolm reacting violently to big momma's explosive diarrhea attack ; malcolm-as-momma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball ; malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments ; malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife ( one of the few sequences that works ) . \\nmartin lawrence can be likeable enough at times , but there's no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character . \\nhe's just big momma without the makeup on . \\ni won't waste time commenting on how ineptly the set-up of the escaped convict is employed , since it was clearly a waste of time to the film-makers . \\nthere are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure , but he's ultimately a distraction in a film that's really about its central visual incongruity ( and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long's posterior ) . \\ni'm never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people -- several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing -- but i know that when a film-maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it's an entire film , i duck out of the way . \\nthe gross implausibility of big momma's house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big , cleverly-constructed laughs . \\nits lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant . \\nbig momma's house is ridiculous _and_ not funny . \\nit's just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . \\n\",\n",

       " b'steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities , because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits , like jurassic park , and \" oscar \" -awarded critical triumphs like schindler\\'s list . \\nhowever , in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories . \\none of them is close encounters of the third kind , extremely popular and influential science-fiction spectacle . \\nunfortunately , it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars . \\nalthough both films have a lot in common ( ground-breaking special effects , brilliant score by john williams ) their future was different ; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon , and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow . \\nwhen spielberg began work on that project , he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit , jaws . \\ntogether with other young directors of his \" new hollywood \" generation , like kauffman , carpenter , hill and millius , he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s , when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment . \\nironically , it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of \" blockubuster \" philosophy . \\nbut in the mid 1970s , many things were different ; spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie . \\nalthough very personal , spielberg\\'s screenplay was partly based on the book \" ufo experience \" by dr . j . allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2 . \\nspielberg was not only inspired by the mythology , but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost , unmatched until the contemporary era of x-files and the roswell anniversary . \\nthat was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo-related incidents as the element of the plot . \\nthe story begins with one of such incidents - team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u . s . navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight 19 . \\nsuch events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary ( richard dreyfuss ) , power company worker from muncie , indiana , who later becomes obsessed with his experience . \\nbecause of his obsession he loses his job , family and sanity , but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler ( melinda dillon ) , single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction . \\nin the meantime , the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and u . s . government , in co-operation with the french , led by lacombe ( francois truffaut ) begin with the preparation for ultra-secret project . \\nwhen the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary , he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area . \\nthere he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions . \\ntwo of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there . \\nspielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects . \\nthe slow , gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents - \" close encounters \" - is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale . \\nbut , instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws , we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder . \\nthroughout the movie the viewer knows that something big , magnificent and wonderful is about to happen , and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end . \\nthe last sequence , with its , even in this age , impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull , would leave many mouths open . \\none of the great virtues of this film is its optimism . \\naliens , who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in science-fiction cinema , are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is a beginning of something wonderful . \\nit is very ironic , when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story - howard hawks\\' thing and byron haskin\\'s war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind . \\nspielberg\\'s humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era ; the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post-watergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public . \\nbut , even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chain-smoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to x-files and its more cynical and disturbing visions . \\nthere lies the main , and probably the only flaw of this great picture - lack of conflict , and consequently , lack of drama . \\nthe movie has few excitements or even action scenes ( especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcock\\'s north by northwest ) but generally , almost everyone - neary , jillian , government , aliens - are the good guys . \\ndespite such shortcomings , the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles . \\nrichard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary , yet nice guy , who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale . \\nmelinda dillon was , on the other hand , nominated for \" oscar \" as a struggling mother , yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as neary\\'s long-suffering wife ronnie . \\napart from visual wonders of this film , spielberg\\'s semi-official composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music , this time using the simple melody both as the element of a plot , and as the basis for his score . \\nthe aliens , who are the main subject of this film , were visually very convincing . \\ntoo convincing , one of my acquaintances in the ufo-researching circles said . \\naccording to him , the depiction of extraterrestrials as grey-skinned little people with big eyes was so accurate , that it managed to freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos . \\nso , they later approached spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien , this time designed to be anything but the real life . \\nthe result was e . t . , for many years the biggest commercial hit of all times , yet less inspirational for ufo enthusiasts . \\nanyway , whether the viewer believes in existence of extraterrestrials or ufos , close encounters of the third kind remains the great movie , and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema . \\n',\n",
       " b'according to the publicity material , with this movie the directors \" hope to restore good old-fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness . \" \\nhmm . \\nyou never know , they just might be on to something . \\nwhat with the rise of geek chic , lounge music and seventies fashion , the ever-contrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own . \\nbut then , i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it . \\nit\\'s cheesy all right , but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch . \\nthat\\'s a shame , because , in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more . \\nwoody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise , roy munson . \\nthe movie opens in the fifties with roy\\'s dad dishing out the reader\\'s digest/gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls , shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever . \\nthe sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray , as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken . \\nit\\'s thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good - he gives the wry , derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy . \\nmccracken dupes munson into a hustling job , then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roy\\'s hand . \\nthen it\\'s fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat , balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand . \\nhe\\'s hopeless until he meets ishmael ( randy quaid ) , an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege . \\nso together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno , picking up pretty hustler claudia ( vanessa angel ) on the way . \\nwith the exit of bill murray , the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go , and that\\'s . . . \\ndumb and dumber . \\nyes , indeed , kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour , peter and bobby farrelly , the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle . \\nso , prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands , distended nipples , ridiculous hair and bull semen . \\nget set for stock fish-out-of-water situations when city-boy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community , or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking , striptease and unchristian neighbour-socking . \\nnow , don\\'t get me wrong , there\\'s nothing wrong with cheap humour , and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy . \\nthe trouble is that these jokes aren\\'t bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction . \\nit lurches from sports movie to amish-mocking to road-trip to sentimental melodrama , ( pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal , and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack ) , never quite getting it all together . \\nsome gags fall flat from a lack of build-up , while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply don\\'t do anything . \\nwhy the long , unfunny fight in the car park ? \\nwhy two of these ? \\nwhy does that guy wear mascara , or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it ? \\nthe film is full of these half-thought-through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer , grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying , \" wouldn\\'t that be funny ? \" . \\nwell , no , actually . \\nthe actors don\\'t do the movie much favours either . \\nwoody harrelson comes off okay , plausibly acting dumb , smart , cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it , but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham , and vanessa angel has no talent ( like schwarzenegger , she seems more convincing playing a computer-creation than a human -- take the tv series weird science . . . please \\n ) . \\neven murray hams it up when he reappears in the movie\\'s climax . \\nall in all , a fairly useless attempt at comedy , and a certified no-hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance . \\nwe\\'ll have to look to a reinspired john waters , or perhaps somebody from down under ( \" strictly bowling \" , anyone ? ) for the definitive bowling comedy . \\nthe flying inkpot\\'s rating system : * wait for the video . \\n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \\n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \\n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \\n * * * * * perfection . \\nsee it twice . \\n',\n",
       " b'of circumcision , psychic wounds and the family sitcom \\nthe opening segment is something of a foretaste of this film . \\nthere\\'s a guy\\'s voice telling us how he tries to imagine what his biological parents look like , and on the screen we see images of a variety of oldish men and women . \\nas his imagination plays o n , he ( and we ) picture these motley characters in a mix-and-match shuffle of unlikely marriages , businesswomen with bums , matrons with paint salesmen , the images coming on in a faster and faster frenzy . \\nit\\'s not just a witty , funny summing up of the film \\'s themes - you might not guess it yet , but it sets the pattern for the way the story goes on . \\nwhat starts out as a step in a fairly sensible direction , gets taken on a road trip , put through a detour or two and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent crash . \\nthat may not sound so different from the average family sitcom , and the general idea of the film doesn\\'t , at first , seem so wildly distant from standard-issue hollywood comedy : man who was adopted as a child ( ben still er ) sets out on a journey to meet his real parents , along with his wife ( patricia arquette ) , his baby , and a pretty psychology-researcher ( tea leoni ) in tow . \\nvarious mix-ups , shenanigans , oddball characters and , yup , disasters follow . \\nbut if you think you\\'ve been here before , the dialogue and the direction ( by david o . russell , who made spanking the monkey ) take it into another dimension . \\nthe dreaded t-name seems an inevitable reference point ( what with a drug overdose scene and the casting of arquette from true romance ) but really the point is that the foot-massage master hasn\\'t got a monopoly on plot twists and fast , funny , irreverent lines , or on the absurdities of ordinary speech . \\nwhether it\\'s about circumcision , psychic wounds , oral sex , carjacking , the beauties of the armpit area , or ronald reagan , the script never seems to run out of hilarious invention . \\nthe best thing is how these words aren\\'t just there for the punchlines , but are great precisely because they\\'re said in character , like tea leoni\\'s neurotically-charged psychobabbler who\\'s able to say under assault , \" it\\'s understandable if you find this threatening \" . \\nthe cast is excellent throughout , and , rather than singling out anybody , kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting , with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue and the sense of a dozen different reagents colliding to the point of fission . \\nthere are some elements of a woody allen film in this ( not to mention the hand-held camera and loose , improvisational feel of some scenes ) . \\nlike allen , russell\\'s interests are in the volatile sexual politics of couples and the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts and children ( and everybody , really ) . \\nstill , if you\\'re expecting a privileged moment of revelation and emotional outpouring a la \" murphy brown \" / \" frasier \" / fill-in-the-blank-american-comedy , well , it won\\'t happen . \\nthe film sets up expectations like these , with the lead character\\'s search f or his origins and his hopes of self-healing , only to knock them down . \\nif the conventional sitcom structure is to put a slightly loopy family in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover their essential lovey one-ness , flirting with disaster\\'s charact ers embark on a journey to seek that essential state but find themselves only plunging into more weirdness and dysfunctional chaos the further they go . \\nand that , the film suggests , is the essential family state - and you better learn to love it . \\nsomehow , this is perversely feelgood cinema , right up to its manic end . \\n',\n",

\\nultimately , however , the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator . \\nwhat does god really think of us ? \\ndoes he resent our abandonment of paradise ? \\nwho exactly is watching us , up there in the sky ? \\nif you enjoy the picture as much as i did , credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work . \\nas for carrey - well , truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play . \\ncarrey is no jimmy stewart ; to his credit , he doesn\\'t try to be . \\nhe just tries to feel the way you or i would , if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us . \\n',\n",

tree--a young male model murdered and frozen to a branch . \\nbelieving at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant , shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building , is responsible for the murder , romulus ( samuel l . jackson ) is put on the trail of an avant-garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould , david leppenraub ( colm feore ) . \\nhis minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation ( romulus was a brilliant julliard-trained pianist prior to his psychosis ) , romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his police-woman daughter ( aunjanue ellis ) that even though he\\'s a nut , that doesn\\'t mean that he can\\'t solve a high-profile society murder . \\nevery moment an exhausting workshop of ideas , and every character the same , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a concept so \" high concept \" that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment , with romulus\\'s \" caveman \" a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane\\'s urban noir hero , spawn . \\nwith a long-vanished wife ( tamara tunie ) acting as a spiritual guide , the occasional social caste commentary , the secret base in a cave , a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters , and a wickedly colourful arch-enemy

\\nthat being said , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy , a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart . \\nthe difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when , in fact , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless ( again like mcfarlane\\'s spawn ) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts . \\nit is no small detail that our hero , romulus , is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life ( in legend ) without knowledge of his royal birth , but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park . in the romulus mythology , signs of romulus\\' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures , while in the film , the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds , but of the carrion itself . \\nwhether or not romulus of _the caveman\\'s valentine_ will found a nation , or , in the case of novelist george dawes green , upon whose novel his own screenplay is based , a franchise , the fact remains that _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far . \\nit , along with m . night shyamalan\\'s _unbreakable_ , is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has , since miller\\'s seminal \" the dark knight returns \" , redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics . \\nreaders of sam keith\\'s brilliant \" the maxx \" comic series ( or of mtv\\'s short-lived animated adaptation of the same ) are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne . \\nthe failure of both \" the maxx \" tv show and of _the caveman\\'s valentine_ ( not forgetting the initial backlash against _unbreakable_ ) suggests that the public may not be ready for america\\'s surprising contributions to dark fantasy . \\nluxuriantly lit , brashly saturated , and comic-panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent ( _death in venice , ca_ ) , while inhabiting robin standefer\\'s ( _practical magic_ ) mesmerizing sets , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film . \\nkasi lemmons , following up her brilliant 1997 debut , _eve\\'s bayou_ , which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism , fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys , artists and suffering . \\n_the caveman\\'s valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape . \\nclearly not for every taste , when approached with the correct paradigm , it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year : a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post-modern audience with urine-stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes . \\n_the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a fine and a courageous film , crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot\\'s rat\\'s alley wasteland . \\n',\n",

       " b\"nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air . \\nthe opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl . \\nthe prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met . \\nif the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should . \\ncage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained . \\nand thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h . i . mcdonnough . \\ncage should have known what he was getting himself into . \\nhe got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production . \\nthe critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance . \\nin the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time . \\nthat sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness . \\nwhile the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage's goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact . \\naudiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production . \\nin fact , the marketing people are counting on it . \\nno one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded . \\ndirector simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) . \\nwhat he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense . \\na bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely . \\nif either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up . \\nat a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool . \\ntheir tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) . \\nin fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts . \\nit is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance . \\nwhile malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . s . marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep . \\nhis recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies . \\nit doesn't bode well for cage's appearance in face/off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over . \\nthere's a word for people like you , nicolas . \\nthat word is called recidivist . . . repeat \\noffender . \\n\",\n",
       " b'film adaptation of hunter s . thompson\\'s infamous semi-autobiographical hallucinogen-fueled book of the same title . \\ndirector terry gilliam of twelve monkeys ( 8/10 ) and brazil ( 7/10 ) fame , took over the helm of this project after fellow director alex cox ( sid and nancy ( 7 . 5/10 ) ) \\n \" apparently alienated everyone associated with the movie \" , according to gilliam . \\nplot : writer thompson ( depp ) heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr . gonzo ( del toro ) to cover a motorcycle race . \\nduring their trip , they systematically consume \" two bags of grass , seventy-five pellets of mescaline , five sheets of high powered blotter acid , a salt shaker half-full of cocaine , a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers , a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of beer , a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls . \\nthe movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use . \\ncritique : i have given this movie two separate ratings because i believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around in the viewer\\'s own mind , whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess . \\nif you are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching this film , i would say that this is one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels . \\nif , on the other hand , you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system , i could not imagine you truly appreciating much of this drug-induced picture\\'s entire ride ( 5 . 5/10 for all those sober dogs ) . \\nnote : i have not read thompson\\'s book . \\nhaving said that , joblo did engage in an alcohol-based consumatory session before ( and during ) the viewing of this film , so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level . \\nthis movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour , rather than substance or plot . \\nit moves admirably from one scene to the next , without much basis of their being , while presenting us with the two days in the life of writer hunter s . thompson during which he seemed to consume more drugs and alcohol than anyone could ever imagine . \\nit was 1971 , and the times were apparently \" a\\' changing \" in the states . \\njohnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop . \\nduring the filming , depp apparently become fast friends with real-life writer thompson , and was known to wander off the set from time to time , for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole . \\ni thought he did seem to exaggerate his walk a little bit too much , but then again , this movie is supposed to be a wild exaggeration of everything and anything , so who am i to talk . \\nthe one thing that did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr . gonzo . \\ni couldn\\'t believe that this fat , samoan lawyer , was the same guy who played the slick mumbling criminal in the usual suspects ( 7 . 5/10 ) . \\nword on the street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role , and i must say that his look was deliciously reprehensible . \\nplenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin , christina ricci , tobey maguire and cameron diaz , along with a bunch of others . \\nother than that , the soundtrack was expectedly eclectic , the style was not as wild as i thought it would be , and the ending was certainly not much of a barn-burner , but then again , who really noticed . \\nthis movie is about visions of bats floating through your head , johnny depp looking goofy and being bald , and the cornucopia of drug-ravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with ideas of anarchy , rebellion and the lost american dream . \\nand for all those who plan on seeing this movie without the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie , i suggest you move further down the aisle , buy yourself a ticket to godzilla ( 6/10 ) , and enjoy the visual fabrications manufactured for the unstimulated mind . \\nlittle known facts : depp and del toro snorted plenty of powdered milk instead of cocaine . \\nbill murray also portrayed a thompson-based character in the film where the buffalo roam . \\njohnny depp turned down roles in the three musketeers , speed ( 7 . 5/10 ) , and legends of the fall ( 7 . 5/10 ) , for smaller and quirkier roles in benny and joon ( 6 . 5/10 ) and what\\'s eating gilbert grape ? \\n ( 7/10 ) . \\nin 1988 , depp told rolling stone magazine that he\\'d tried every drug by the age of 14 . \\njohnny hung out with some of the members of oasis while filming the uncompleted divine rapture in ireland , and later played some slide guitar on the 1997 album , be here now . \\njohnny was born in kentucky , is a high-school dropout , has nicknamed himself \" mr . stench \" , has been engaged to four women until now ( including actress winona ryder , whose \" winona forever \" tattoo had to be altered to \" wino forever \" after their breakup ) , currently plays guitar in a band called \" p \" , and owns the viper room nightclub in l . a . \\n',\n",
       " b'as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it , the more pleased i was when i left . \\nfirst , getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz : \" if you liked scream , you\\'ll love wild things ! \" \\n \" campbell gives a stunning performance ! \" \\n \" this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days ! \" \\n ( oh yeah , the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me ) \\nnow , onto more serious stuff ( and with this film , i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way ) . \\nwild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa . \\ni\\'m not saying that in a bad way , but when you see this film , you may be shocked by what you see . \\nhowever , perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film\\'s charming cast and tricky plot , that they let the film slide with an r rating . \\nbeing mormon , i\\'m bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film . \\ntrouble is , i have already seen it . \\nand i like it ! \\nwild things is a film noir of the 90s , filled with 40s sensibilities , and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture . \\nthe style in which it is filmed is rich in color . \\nthe actors are all gorgeous people , seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film . \\nsure , it\\'s all too good to be true , but ain\\'t it fun to watch ? \\nwhen movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it . \\nthere will be people who don\\'t want to admit liking what they see , but i tell you , most anyone who sees this will like it . \\nwild things begins at blue bay high school , the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into . \\nit\\'s almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone ) . \\nof course , there are those select few who may look slightly ugly , but compared to the average person , they are gorgeous . \\nimmediately , the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time . \\nwe can turn off our brains , right ? \\nwrong . \\nwhile you may be expecting one thing to happen , it certainly doesn\\'t turn out that way . \\nthe film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present . \\nthere\\'s sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a counselor for the students . \\nhe\\'s heading the class discussion . \\nthere\\'s also kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam . \\nteaching the class , however , are two policemen : ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) , who want to talk about \\'sex . . . \\n ( cheers ) crimes ( boos ) \\' . \\n \" what is a sex crime ? \" \\nray asks . \\n \" not gettin\\' any ! \" \\none student responds . \\nthis pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch . \\nhowever , upon hearing this , one student , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , stands up and leaves the room , commenting that they can both kiss part of her body . \\nand so , wild things sets into motion . \\nquickly , kelly begins hitting on sam , but sam doesn\\'t want anything to do with her advances . \\nkelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him . \\nshe even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep . \\nsurprisingly , that\\'s really all i can tell you about the plot . \\nany more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists . \\nand what\\'s more , these plot twists are actually unpredictable . \\ngoing along the way of scream , wild things maintains that film\\'s surprises , and then adds even more to them . \\nthere are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen . \\nand even though you think you may get tired of them , the surprises are so genuine that it\\'s rather pleasing . \\ngoing back over them in my mind , nearly all of them work , though some stretch the boundaries of belief . \\nthankfully , the convoluted plot doesn\\'t give us much time to think about each one , pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off . \\nas for the critics who complain that the film is trashy--well , it is . \\nthis is pretty much just one trashy film . \\nhowever , it is the kind of trashy that isn\\'t hard to watch . \\nit\\'s good trash , in a sense . \\none , the screenplay knows that it\\'s not to be taken seriously , and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story . \\nthis varies everywhere from kelly\\'s mother ( theresa russell ) , who is more of a caricature of rich people , all the way to an ambulance-chasing lawyer ( bill murray ) , who wears a neck-brace to cover an insurance scam he is running . \\nbill murray also provides the best character in the film , and most of the genuine laughs . \\nand two , the sex is more than gratuitous , although not unwelcomed . \\nwild things is supposed to have sex in it ( what film with that title wouldn\\'t ? ) , and this movie breaks the boundaries . \\ninstead of having heterosexual sex scenes , it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell ( don\\'t worry . . . \\nit\\'s not as graphic as you might think ) . \\nthe heterosexual scenes are quite graphic , but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon\\'s full-frontal nude scene . \\nit\\'s very brief , so if you blink , you may miss ( ahem ) it . \\nand , for as long as i can remember , i don\\'t think i have seen an r-rated film show an erect one before ( it\\'s not completely , but judging from the audiences\\' reaction , it was more than they expected too ) . \\nalso , during one scene late in the film , there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon\\'s characters , but nothing came of it ( makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating , or if the actors refused to do it ) . \\nwhat first made me want to see wild things was its cast . \\nneve campbell , of course , has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released . \\nhere , however , she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead . \\nthe closest role to this was her performance in the craft ( though even in that she was a nice girl ) . \\ncampbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent . \\nyou can tell she will be around for a long time . \\ndenise richards will also be around for a long time , although she may be limited to the roles without much range . \\nhere , she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff ( yet effective ) performance in starship troopers . \\nhopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability . \\nand then there is daphne rubin-vega , a newcomer to the movies . \\nshe gives a very good performance , although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half . \\ntowards the end she does get a bigger part . \\non the male side , matt dillon is probably the best , giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist . \\nkevin bacon has a slightly wooden character , but he makes the most of it . \\nyou must have admiration , though , for what he did on screen . \\nand judging from many of the women\\'s reactions in the theater to that shot , they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon ( yeah , right ) . \\nand then there is bill murray . \\nhis performance is the comic relief , and he nearly steals the film . \\nas a whole , the entire cast works wondrously together , and they seem at home , even when doing the menage a troi . \\ndirector john mcnaughton , who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry : portrait of a serial killer , has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works . \\nhis direction is smooth and stylish . \\nthe visuals are striking , filled with rich colors , and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air . \\nhowever , he seems more at home when the actors aren\\'t talking . \\nhis fly-by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant , and his photography of denise richards\\' climbing out of the pool is a highlight . \\nthe cinematography is gorgeous in its details . its not often that you see a film like this , and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures . \\nthen , there is the music . \\nthis was probably the most obvious thing to me , as it set the perfect mood for the film . \\nit\\'s hard to describe in words , so just see the film and listen to it . \\nit\\'s wonderfully composed and presented . \\nand be sure to stick around during the closing credits ! \\nmcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use ( while most comedies use it for outtakes ) . \\nhe has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events . \\nsome may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot , but it\\'s an entertaining way to finish the film . \\nplus , there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun . \\nwild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality , nudity , language and violence . \\nagain , the nudity is rather unnecessary , but let\\'s face it--people want to see it . \\nso why not give it to them ? \\nneve campbell , admirably , has a no-nudity clause in her contract , and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off ( way to go , neve ! ) . \\nthe sex scenes are graphic , especially the first one we see , between the mother and one of her deck hands . \\none almost wonders how they got away with the r rating . \\nthe language is quite harsh too , ranging from sexual innuendo to your average , everyday profanity . \\nand i can\\'t stress it enough : don\\'t allow kids under 18 to see this film . \\nthe target age for the movie is the 18-24 range , and that\\'s who should see it . \\nit\\'s definitely not for those under 18 ! \\ndid i mention that this film is rated r ? however , for those that do get a chance to watch it , you will probably more likely be pleased , and may even take friends to see it the next time . \\n',\n",

! ) . \\nfinally , just one word : monsters . \\nfaye dunaway and peter o\\'toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o\\'toole overacts he\\'s entertaining and when dunaway does it she\\'s annoying ( her character actually says the line \" seize them ! \" \\nat one point ) . \\ndunaway\\'s henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty\\'s otis character from the first two superman movies . \\nhelen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she\\'s written to be , as she\\'s able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable . \\nbelievability aside though , it\\'s still annoying . \\nnow despite all this negativity ( and i\\'m not alone here . . . supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles ) , leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested , but excited about its release on dvd ! \\nthey have released two separate editions of the film on dvd , to the delight of many people ( including myself . . . \\nyet i\\'m still unclear as to why , since this movie is so awful ) . \\nthe first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u . s . theaters . \\nthe movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 . 35 : 1 , is enhanced for 16x9 televisions , and has been remastered in full thx glory . \\nextras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and \" special project consultant \" scott michael bosco , the excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl-the making of a feature ( dig that workout montage ! ) , 5 trailers , 3 tv spots , talent bios , in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie ) , and assorted still galleries . \\nthe transfer on this international version is incredible . . . \\nyou\\'d think you were watching a new release . \\nimages are sharp , colors jump off the screen , and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts . \\nonly some special effects sequences show the wear of time , and there just isn\\'t much that can be done about that ( unless you\\'re obsessive like george lucas ) . \\nthe new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places , however you\\'ll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score ( which is completely unrelated to john williams\\' classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films\\' golan-globus production ) . \\nthe commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries . \\nbosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there\\'s no dead air on the track . \\nbosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation . \\nalthough , at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc , and is surprised when he doesn\\'t get that response . \\nwe learn some fascinating tidbits on the track , most notably the \" almost \" appearance in the film by christopher reeve . \\ngreat detail is given about superman\\'s proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out . \\nas it stands , superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission . \\nfor the sake of brevity , i won\\'t even get into that one . \\nszwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own , replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy \" whimsical fantasy \" nonsense . \\nbosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along , claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office . \\nagain , for the sake of brevity , i won\\'t even get into that one . \\nanchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50 , 000 copies pressed ) two-disc set . \\ndisc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release . \\ndisc two features the never before seen director\\'s cut of the film , which runs 138 minutes long . \\nthe additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don\\'t add much of note , except for a few moments which lengthen peter o\\'toole\\'s screen time ( particularly during his latter appearances ) . \\nthe print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono , but fans of the film won\\'t care . \\none question though . . . \\nshouldn\\'t the director\\'s commentary be on the director\\'s cut of the film ? \\ni\\'d never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd . \\ni was nine when it was released to theaters , and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it . \\nso when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect . \\ni knew the film wasn\\'t beloved and i never had any interest in it before , but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc . \\nas the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence , which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong . \\ncome to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo . . . \\nso i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started . \\nat the end of the film , supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron , and flies back to argo city . \\nugh , i give up . \\ni\\'m surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once , not twice , but three times to review these discs . \\nsupergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package , but a very lousy movie . \\n[pg] \\n',\n",

tense moment again . \\nit is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked . \\nthis creates some strange effects . \\nthe stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships . \\nthe strands have varying degrees of bizarre content . \\nwe have the story of a dying man earl partridge ( jason robards ) wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends . \\nphil parma ( philip seymour hoffman ) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal . \\npartridge\\'s young wife linda ( julianne moore ) is getting more and more anxious as

\\neach story moves toward a single bizarre common climax , but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story . \\nthe common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories . \\nthe film seems to be built around strange events and weird history , but it really has little to do with the content of the stories , though they all are connected in

by updrafts , and finally dropped elsewhere . \\nso while the rain is possible , some doubts do creep in . \\nthe rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a

       " b'a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal . \\na soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another . \\na common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain . \\na terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end . \\nif the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues . \\nit is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label . \\nedward zwick\\'s the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states . \\nyou\\'d think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines . \\narab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u . s . responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack . \\nhowever , unlike the real-life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden\\'s camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal . \\nin retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world . \\nunwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent-in-charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau\\'s new york office at one federal plaza . \\nwhile investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information . \\ngenerally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u . s . , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm . \\neven spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country . \\nhubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government . \\nthe original tagline for patriot games was , \" there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil . \" \\nhowever true , it was pulled before the movie\\'s release because it sounded too much like a dare . \\nrevisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself , because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america . \\nadmittedly , the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive ( who\\'s going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two-thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid . \\ni liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action-thriller fare of good guy g-men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order . \\nit provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab-american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself . \\nin fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk . \\nalthough it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups . \\nthroughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully . \\nwhat results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides . \\nit actually gets rather heady at times , but it\\'s a credit to screenwriters zwick , lawrence wright , and menno meyjes that they don\\'t underestimate the intelligence of the audience . \\ni don\\'t know if it\\'s his tone or inflection or something else , but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great . \\nthis , combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid-level authority figure , makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable . \\nannette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i\\'ve seen recently , and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable . \\nit\\'s somewhat unfortunate that her character\\'s fortitude is broken at a certain point , but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range . \\nbruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough-guy role , always standing straight , and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face . \\nhowever , the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film\\'s development . \\nnotable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad , a lebanese immigrant . \\nthe role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage , and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society . \\ndifficult to say the least , shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch . \\nperhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom \" wings , \" shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night . \\nwhereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick\\'s favorite actor ( he directed washington in glory and courage under fire ) , james horner seems to be his favorite composer . \\ni therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score-writer graeme revell ( seven films this year already ) over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian-themed music , and horner\\'s record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish-sounding at most . \\nrevell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole . \\nit\\'s nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we\\'ve been getting throughout the year . \\nmissteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes . \\nfor example , it\\'s pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick . \\nunfortunately , there\\'s a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions , obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye-catching . \\nin the middle of the city ( and against no real opposition ) , zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops . \\nverisimilitude really goes out the window at that point . \\nthe film also gets a little preachy toward the end , focusing on the ability of different races to get along . \\na noble gesture , the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously . \\nthese flaws are glaring , but they don\\'t detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class . \\n',\n",

       " b'one of the responses those that enjoy \" detroit rock city \" ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i\\'ve given the film might be something like : \" oh , that casey\\'s gone and become a jaded critic on us . \\njust what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n\\' roll movie like this ? \" \\ni\\'m wondering the same thing . \\ni feel like i should have had a grand time with \" detroit rock city . \" \\nit\\'s the sort of movie i wish i could\\'ve had a lot of fun with , but i didn\\'t . \\ni just didn\\'t . \\nsurely this film isn\\'t trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ? \\nno , but i expected something . \\na funny joke . \\na clever prank . \\na plot development . \\nanything . \\nthe movie never delivers . \\nyou\\'ve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . \\n \" detroit rock city \" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film\\'s existence , and it\\'s not a very satisfying realization . \\nthe film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan . \\nthat\\'s it . \\nthere is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot . \\nthe characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) . \\nthey have a garage band . \\nthey\\'re pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n\\' roll , so i guess that means we root for them . \\nthey have tickets , they lose them . \\nthey get more tickets , they lose those too . \\nthey come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire . \\nthere\\'s not much more to it . \\nfrankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys\\' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity . \\noh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency . \\nshe doesn\\'t want them to see kiss , if you hadn\\'t figured that out already . \\nit\\'s really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this . \\nwe\\'ve got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy . \\nthen again , \" maximum overdrive \" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time . \\n \" detroit rock city \" doesn\\'t quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close . \\nin fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind . \\nbasically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc\\'s \" highway to hell \" sounds like something my neighbor\\'s cat coughed up ) . \\nit\\'s also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it\\' s evident that they\\'re all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie . \\nedward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they\\'ve got to make a living in hollywood . \\npeople wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song . \\ntoo bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess . \\ndirector adam rifkin knows he hasn\\'t got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning . \\nwe get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script . \\nit\\'s fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting . \\ni would recommend that those who felt seasick at \" the blair witch project \" stay far away from \" detroit rock city , \" because the witch has got nothing on this baby . \\ni haven\\'t felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since \" armageddon . \" \\nand what about that script ? \\nit\\'s written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i\\'ve ever heard . \\nif it is , i can\\'t say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible . \\na plotless , pointless rock n\\' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny . \\nthe jokes in \" detroit rock city \" rarely are . \\nin fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal . \\nthe rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it \" comedy . \" \\nthere is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don\\'t provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up . \\nit\\'s as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , \" see ? \\nfunny ! \" \\nlook , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink . \\nsee ? \\nfunny ! \\nlook , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver . \\ntwice . \\nsee ?

       " b'i have no real tangible proof of this , but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script , written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director , then it is actually possible to make a good movie . \\nusing their logic , all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super-famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget . \\nthis is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time ( not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre ) . \\nnow , before i continue to ferociously attack what\\'s wrong with this film , i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller . \\ncatherine zeta-jones plays virginia baker , an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal ( sean connery ) . \\nif you\\'ve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before , i really don\\'t have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details : the two team up for various jobs , stealing various things for various purposes . \\nthe problem we come to is that we\\'ve all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesn\\'t break any new ground in the big-budget/hollywood/action genre . \\nthe result is that the entire production feels contrived . \\ni\\'m going to be completely honest here : pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run-time was looking at catherine zeta-jones . \\nnow while this may be a compliment for ms . zeta-jones , it certainly isn\\'t for either the writers or the director , who are not nearly as clever as they think they are . \\njust about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between \" entrapment \" and \" blackmail \" . \\nwith an eighty million dollar budget , you\\'d think that entrapment would at least feature edge-of-your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f/x . \\nwell , you\\'d be wrong . \\nthe action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular . \\nunfortunately for all those involved with entrapment , die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by ? 11 years . \\nthe reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture , you know exactly what\\'s going to happen , despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists . \\nmany scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta-jones in extremely tight-fitting clothing . \\none particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask . \\nnothing wrong with that , but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was - so why didn\\'t she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room ? \\ni\\'ll tell you why : because it\\'s a great excuse to photograph zeta-jones\\' posterior as it slides underneath those beams ( and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing - the rehearsal ) . \\nving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie , and though he has great screen presence ( although so do connery and zeta-jones ) and the most interesting character in the film , not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss ( a concept i invented just to describe this picture ) . \\none last complaint : entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building , or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot , he\\'ll spontaneously disappear in ninja-like fashion . \\ni can picture amiel patting himself on the back , thinking to himself \" it\\'ll leave the audience wondering for days : how did he do that ? \" \\nwe know jon , it\\'s called editing . \\n',\n",
       " b'seen august 8 , 1998 at 6 p . m . at rotterdam square cinemas ( rotterdam , ny ) , theater #6 , by myself for free using my sony/loews critic\\'s pass . \\n[theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] \\nwar is a topic that can\\'t help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media . \\nmovies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory . \\nit\\'s easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other . \\nforgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh-and-blood person and not just a number . \\n \" saving private ryan \" is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery . \\nit proves there\\'s a huge difference between battling and killing . \\nthe film opens with one of the most graphic , disturbing scenes in recent memory . \\nit\\'s world war ii , d-day to be exact , and the u . s . military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them . \\nspielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality . \\ninstead of positioned cameras , the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared . \\nthere is no sense of stability , but of constant , anxious , and confusing motion , giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle , and just a vulnerable as the poor troops . \\n \" poor \" is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are . \\nthere is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters . \\nwe don\\'t get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles , but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding . \\nthe nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated , but as people that must be destroyed because they\\'re there . \\nin the movies , the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch , but in reality that wouldn\\'t happen . \\nthe men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies . \\nthey are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well-secured germans who can actually see who , what , and where they\\'re shooting , unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off . \\nperhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are , but that seems to be part of the theme . \\nthe film seems to rely on the audience\\'s sense of patriotism , that the american military is \" right \" and good and that the nazis are \" inherently evil . \" \\nthe battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold ( a whole 50-foot progression ) , and begin to inflict some damage . \\ni have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up , i couldn\\'t help but feel some sense of joy and relief . \\nto triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure , but there\\'s nothing cliche about the graphic , detailed , atmosphere here because it really happened . \\none of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is , and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting . \\nthe plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet . \\ntom hanks stars as captain miller , a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon . \\nhe\\'s never obsessive or any such generic , cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this . \\nhe doesn\\'t want to be there any more than his men , but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out . \\nthe mission the film is concerned with is , as the title states , saving private ryan . \\nthrough a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker , it is brought to a general\\'s attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each\\'s death simultaneously . \\nwhen they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe , they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother . \\nit\\'s easy to sympathize with this situation , after all , no one should have to lose all their children at once . \\nbut finding one man in this war is , as miller puts it , \" like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles . \" \\nthe saving of private ryan isn\\'t just a dramatic device , but a thematic one . \\nhis salvation represents the sense of innocence the country , the world even , was trying to convince itself it still had . \\nwhen miller\\'s company hears of the mission , they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead , but miller isn\\'t so quick to shrug it off . \\nhe knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope , and now he has the opportunity to make someone\\'s sense of hope a reality . \\nthe mission to find ryan gives miller\\'s group a destination , but not direction . \\nalong the way many things happen to them , both good and bad . \\na few battles are fought , not to be major accomplishments for the war , but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice . \\nthe act of killing itself becomes one of the film\\'s major philosophical metaphors . \\nthe soldiers don\\'t mind killing other soldiers in blind battle , but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go , they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses . \\nunfortunately , death is a fact of war , and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters , but here spielberg doesn\\'t want us to think these men are invincible .

       " b'if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell\\'s infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era\\'s heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat . \\nso when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) . \\nmy , how easily does the worm turn . \\nhype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics . \\nat the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers\\'s last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included . \\nand with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . . \\nboring . \\nalthough christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_\\'s lifelessness . \\n_54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o\\'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender . \\nthese characters are about as generic as those descriptions . \\nin focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat . \\nwith the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers\\' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club\\'s famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow\\'s feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she\\'s a peripheral character at best ) . \\nas such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ . \\nwhat is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ? \\neven whit stillman\\'s _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn\\'t so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene . \\ndancing isn\\'t the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher\\'s fault . \\nfrom what i\\'ve heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54\\'s legend . \\nbut somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film . \\naside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane\\'s fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored . \\nshane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold . \\nthis tacked-on \" romance \" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience . \\nthey fail on both counts . \\nultimately , _54_\\'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n . \\nas in , there isn\\'t any to be had for the audience . \\ntoo much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place . \\nanyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively . \\nwhen anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn\\'t get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film\\'s conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) . \\nstrangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying . \\nthere is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them . \\nthey\\'re on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 . \\nthese two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there\\'s still a great disco movie to be made . \\nthe problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course . \\n',\n",
       " b'let\\'s say you live at the end of an airport runway . \\nlarge jetliners continuously pass over your house , rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace . \\nlet\\'s say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances , and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home . \\nnow let\\'s say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway , and offers you more than it\\'s worth . \\nwouldn\\'t you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed ? \\nof course you would . \\nbut what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise , and the house your castle ? \\nthat\\'s what they are to darryl kerrigan ( michael caton ) , and although he\\'s happy that a multi-national corporation would like to buy his home , sorry , it\\'s not for sale . \\nunfortunately , the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government , which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice . \\nnot about to take this lying down , darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto ( tiriel mora ) and makes a determined , albeit pathetic , attempt to fight back . \\nthe castle , an australian comedy by rob sitch , is perhaps one of the simplest movies i\\'ve seen in recent memory , yet also one of the funniest . \\nin fact , it is this film\\'s reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful . \\nthe good guys and the bad guys are clear , the humor is straightforward , and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets . \\nit\\'s the perfect setup for a relaxing , hilarious good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i liked the fact that i didn\\'t have to think all that much while watching this film . \\ni just sat back and enjoyed myself . \\nthe situation is one we\\'ve seen before : regular joe fights back against the government , or big business , or whatever . \\nwhat makes this film different is its characters . \\ndarryl thinks he\\'s got the best life in the world - he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind , he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he\\'s got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal ( anne tenny ) , and he swells with pride when his son dale ( stephen curry ) digs a hole in the yard . \\nsteve kerrigan ( anthony simcoe ) constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for \" investments \" like jousting sticks and overhead projectors , while wayne kerrigan is in jail , as a result of dennis denuto\\'s incompetent courtroom maneuvers . \\nthe great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren\\'t so stupid that they get annoying . \\nthey\\'re just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing . \\nwe look upon them with a little bit of pity , but a whole lot of affection . \\nscreenwriters sitch , santo cilauro , tom gleisner , and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate , further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans . \\nsympathy for their situation , the laughter they bring us , and the family\\'s wonderful characterization , simple as it may be , leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them . \\ni suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans , but trust me , it works . \\ni particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong - slapstick , when executed well , can be genius . \\nit\\'s just that too often , a film will resort to it\\'s use as a shortcut to amusing the audience , not always successfully . \\ninstead , the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world . \\nwhen they are by themselves , the are funny , and when they are with normal people , they are hilarious . \\none of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though . \\nthe kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film\\'s running time . \\nluckily , it\\'s a funny little detour that , while slightly distracting from the film\\'s main drive , is still quite enjoyable . \\nwith all the levity abound in the castle , the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept , that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property , an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes . \\ni\\'m not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life , but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution ( of australia ) and certainly sounds impressive at any rate . \\nand , for that matter , it\\'s more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this . \\n',\n",

       " b\"the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie , complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence . \\nit's not abhorrent , or even blatantly unlikable , but it doesn't make a shred of sense . \\nand whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film ? \\njames foley knows a lot about characters and acting , and those are the strengths of the corruptor . \\nbut the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense , and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train . \\nat least we have chow yun-fat in the lead role . \\nchow plays nick chen , a chinatown cop . \\nhe's a good cop , as the first few scenes establish , and he's very familiar with chinatown . \\nthat's probably why the powers-that-be decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace ( mark wahlberg ) . \\nnick and danny begin by stepping on each other's toes , but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other one's life . \\nwhat happens after that is kind of a mystery to me . \\ni'm fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons , led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu ( byron mann ) . \\ni'm also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ( ric young ) , a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff . \\ni'm not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny , although this makes for some ridiculous ( albeit unpredictable ) plot twists along the way . \\nthere's also an interesting subplot revolving around danny's father ( brian cox ) , but it doesn't have much to do with the main story . \\none of the problems , as i said , is that the movie doesn't make any sense . \\ni don't blame this entirely on foley , because he's obviously a good director . \\ni'm more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci's script , which doesn't seem to be in tune to the way normal people act . \\none scene early on had me particularly annoyed : nick confronts his boss because he's angry about his new white partner . \\nhe's shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture , and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me . \\n ( in addition , the film takes a bite into race-related issues , and never develops them at all . ) \\nthere are a lot of scenes like this one , and none of them are very coherent . \\nthere's also a considerable language barrier , given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents . \\nthe plot itself never straightens out . \\ni'm not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are , or why henry lee is associated with them , or what they do as a group . \\nthe corruptor is an action movie , and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences . \\nthe sequences aren't bad , but they're not new ; how many car chases through chinatown have you seen ? \\non that note , how many chinatown cop movies have you seen ? \\none too many , i'd imagine . \\nfoley's strength is clearly in characterization , and he does a pretty good job here . \\nthe scenes between nick and danny are very good , and i actually got a feel for their characters ; a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together . \\nchow and wahlberg are both good actors ; chow is a pro , and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep . \\nwahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere , but he's still fun to watch . \\ni also liked the subplot involving danny's father ; brian cox's performance is powerful , and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny . \\nbut the film ultimately fails , mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly-familiar action scenes . \\na complicated plot can be successful , but the story needs to make sense when it's over . \\nthe corruptor never manages to make any sense -- it just keeps spinning out of control until , finally , there's nothing left to hold on to . \\n\",\n",

       " b'i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars . \\nfrom my first viewing , i noticed that david mamet\\'s film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning . \\nfrom my second viewing however , i noticed that mamet\\'s script was actually a masterpiece . \\nthe spanish prisoner , like the usual suspects or chinatown , begs for the viewer\\'s complete attention . \\nmiss a scene or even a small detail , and you could miss the meaning of the entire film . \\nalso like the aforementioned films , it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising and memorable ending . \\nmamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games . \\nlike his past gem , the spanish prisoner fools the audience as much ( or even more ) than the victim . \\nbecause we were deceived just like the victim , we feel a strong attachment to the main character and consequently are more interested in the film . \\nmamet has the talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped , but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end . \\nthe power that he has in forcing the viewer to determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over , without giving a right answer , is unique and ingenious . \\nthe spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued . \\nafter seeing the film again , i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening . \\nhis direction is very subtle ; as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them , or think you see all of them . \\nthe story follows a young up and coming businessman , joe ross , ( campbell scott ) who has just created a mysterious and lucrative \" process \" that everyone is trying to get their hands on . \\nsoon ross does not know who he can trust or who is after his \" process . \" \\nthrough his journey ross meets a number of mysterious characters : the rich and popular jimmy dell , a secretary who has a huge crush on ross , and ross\\' boss mr . klein . \\nplayed by steve martin , rebecca pidgeon , and ben gazarra respectively , the supporting cast is very solid especially martin , who deserved an oscar nomination for his commanding and manipulative role . \\nthe most interesting character in the film , though , was campbell scott\\'s joe ross . \\nthe character\\'s transformation from an ingenuous and polite rookie to a paranoid veteran is very apparent and justifiable . \\ndavid mamet\\'s script is so interesting because we know people don\\'t actually talk like the characters in the film , yet we feel so connected to some of them . \\nhis beguiling style could fool any viewer up for the challenge . \\nthis is a must see , for those interested in solving a complex puzzle of a movie . \\n',\n",

       " b'mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence . ) \\nwith three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest \" hot properties \" in action adventure stardom , and it\\'s just about time . \\nfor over twenty-five years , jackie\\'s been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy . \\n \" drunken master \" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to \" make it big \" --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong . \\ni\\'m not entirely sure why , exactly . \\nin many ways , \" drunken master \" is similar to most of jackie\\'s other early films , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii , \" master with cracked fingers \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , \" spiritual kung fu \" , and others . \\nin fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories . \\nto be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste . \\nthey\\'re quite different from action movies as we know them in america . \\nthese films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together . \\n \" drunken master \" , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception . \\n ( as an aside , \" drunken master \" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen . . . in \\na movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival . \\nat the time , i didn\\'t really think it was anything special . . . but \\nafter having seen more films like it , it\\'s kind of grown on me . ) \\n \" drunken master \" \\'s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii and \" master with cracked fingers \" --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been \" adapted , \" to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) . \\nmore specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka \" naughty panther , \" a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough . \\nafter embarrassing his instructor\\'s assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can . . . and \\nis further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively . \\nhis father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages . \\nkei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all . \\nwhile escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more . \\nthis turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu . \\nhe assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up . \\nthen , when he\\'s ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu . \\nunfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them . . . \\n \" drunken master \" features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others . \\nit\\'s been said before , but i\\'ll say it again--these fights don\\'t just _happen_ , they\\'re as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows . \\nin his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways . \\nthe fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films . \\nwhether jackie wins or loses , it\\'s really something to see . . . and \\nit\\'s often as funny as anything , too . \\nand funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at . \\nthere\\'s very little that\\'s new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training . . . these \\nschticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties . \\nbut they\\'re still hilarious as ever . \\nlikewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they\\'re often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own . \\nthe really big thing about \" drunken master \" , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu . \\ni\\'m not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and \\nit apparently helps if you\\'re drunk while you\\'re doing it . \\ngenuine or not , i have to admit , there\\'s just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what\\'s going on . \\ncome to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film\\'s success over any of the other jackie films . . . it\\'s \\nnot just martial arts , it\\'s the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , \" whoa . . . \" \\non the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background . \\n \" gone with the wind \" , this isn\\'t . \\nstill , if you like martial arts films , or like what you\\'ve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot . \\nit\\'s much more \" real \" than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme . \\nyou might very well like it . \\nanother interesting thing about \" drunken master \" has to do with its video availability in the us . \\n \" drunken master \" is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 ) . \\nthere are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase . \\nthankfully , \" drunken master \" , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price . \\nif you like \" drunken master \" , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren\\'t really _too_ bad . . . if \\nnothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) . \\ni particularly recommend \" spiritual kung fu \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , the \" fearless hyena \" movies , and \" snake & crane arts of shaolin \" . \\nalso , the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel , \" drunken master ii \" , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer . \\nalso , for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei-hong ( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore ) , i\\'ve been told to suggest the \" once upon a time in china \" series starring jet li ( though i haven\\'t personally seen any of them yet ) . \\nif you choose to watch \" drunken master \" , i really hope you enjoy it , and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that\\'s out there . \\nall in all , i give this film an . \\n',\n",

proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer . \\nhe graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god . \\nhe is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck . \\nhis life seems to be on the rise . \\nand of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline . \\nhe is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment . \\nmary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted . \\nmeanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t . nelson ) who apparently murdered three people . \\nhe spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane . \\nall of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself . \\nafter a while , things turn completely upside-down , as kevin\\'s wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends . \\na fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin\\'s real father . \\nis it all just a big nightmare ? \\nor is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin\\'s life ? \\nthe devil\\'s advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don\\'t expect . \\nis this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ? \\nif so , the devil\\'s advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early . \\ni went into the devil\\'s advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got . \\ni was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got . \\nbut what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn\\'t like the ending ? ) . \\nthe producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you . \\nfilms like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less . \\nwe know it is going to end in an unpredictable way . \\nthe devil\\'s advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all . \\nif that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again . \\nas for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study . \\nthe film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that ) . \\nand then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur . \\nit was at this point that i felt cheated . \\ntaking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film . \\neverything occurs from his perspective . \\nhe is our representation on screen ( sort of ) . \\nbut we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game . \\ni don\\'t want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself . \\nperhaps the most shocking thing about the devil\\'s advocate is the extreme amount of everything . \\nit earned its r rating for a reason . \\nthere is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity . \\nthis film really isn\\'t subtle about anything , showing us everything . \\nit actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh . \\nhowever , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those . \\ni don\\'t condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it . \\nthe biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch . \\nthe confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann . \\nportrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann\\'s problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline . \\nthis may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her . \\nshe is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted . \\nsomething the devil\\'s advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature . \\nthe story actually has something to say about humanity . \\nin one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) . \\nhe comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity . \\nthen , god sets up rules which contradict human nature . \\nthis semi-religious bashing is more humorous than frightening . \\nwhat milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true . \\nthese moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil\\'s advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i\\'m sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) . \\nwhen a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched . \\nthe cast of the devil\\'s advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we don\\'t expect . \\nheather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job . \\nprobably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves . \\nhe has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance . \\ni have never seen him more believable to date . \\nal pacino is of course the scene stealer . \\nhis devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) . \\nhe could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term ) . \\njeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller\\'s day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon . \\njudith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin\\'s past . \\nconnie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times . \\none familiar face with a twist was \" coach \" star , craig t . nelson , who gives a very good performance . \\nthe devil\\'s advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore . \\nat 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly . \\nfor the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters . \\nthe technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score . \\ndirector taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes . \\ni guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film , and hackford gave me just that for a long time . \\nbut just before the end , he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream . \\npersonally , i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early . \\n',\n",

       " b'after having heard so many critics describe \" return to me \" as an old-fashioned hollywood romance , i kept asking myself going into this movie : what exactly is an old-fashioned hollywood romance ? \\nwhat made \" return to me \" old-fashioned and old-hollywood ? \\nwas it the tunes from sinatra , etc . , legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ? \\nwas it the glamorous , sophisticated feel ? \\nthe charisma of the two leads ? \\neven now i can\\'t say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer , because i haven\\'t see that many old-fashioned hollywood romances . \\ni don\\'t think any of the romances i\\'ve seen have been classified as such . \\nwhich leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics -- \" return to me \" was old-fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic , the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider . \\nit was traditional , magical . \\nwe knew it couldn\\'t be too daring , or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in . \\nit was a romance told with such endearing simplicity , tenderness , and love ( from director bonnie hunt ) that it couldn\\'t help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings . \\nthe film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt\\'s direction . \\nfrom the very first bird\\'s eye view of chicago , zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland ( david duchovny ) , accompanied by the \" return to me \" ballad ( by whom ? ) , we can tell we\\'re in for something sweet . \\nthe scenes between the characters are endearing , truthful , with just a hint of fantasy . \\nreal people don\\'t act that way ; real people aren\\'t that nice . \\nwe know all this , and yet we want to believe in these folks\\' existence . \\nthe premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale , but hunt\\'s rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal . \\neverything is ordinary--yet beautiful--in this film . \\n>from the festive little family restaurant to grace ( minnie driver ) and bob\\'s wardrobes . \\nfrom the eloquent , not-in-a-hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints . \\nfrom the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen -- the most beautiful part . \\n \" return to me \" has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family : the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist . \\nwe care for them , laugh with them , cry with them ; we\\'re concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father . \\nwhatever hunt did , she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors . \\ndisappointingly , david alan grier\\'s charlie , however much i like him , was the most flatly-written . \\nduchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona -- with the help of his fellow co-stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder . \\ninstead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of \" the x-files . \" \\nduchovny , who is excellent at understatement and self-deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen . \\nminnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet , innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer . \\nthough an unlikely pair , duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses . \\nwhile \" return to me \" functions remarkably as a laugh-out-loud comedy , a romantic scenic tour through chicago , and a tearjerker , the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop . \\nthe entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife\\'s heart . \\nwe already know that there\\'s going to be a happy ending ; we feel like we spend the entire film , however enjoyably , in a straight line going towards that point . \\nas a result bob and grace click almost too quickly--yes , i know she\\'s supposed to have his ex-wife\\'s heart and everything--it seems too effortless . \\nthe main subject is a love story , and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters ( whose story might not have that much meat after all ) . \\nhowever , in the spirit of \" return to me , \" it won\\'t do to be too picky about how \" old \" hollywood tells its stories . \\ni loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt . \\nit shows . \\nthe bottom line : \" return to me \" is nothing remarkable , and yet its sweetness , sincerity , and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadn\\'t imagined . \\n',\n",
       " b\"this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney's live- action george of the jungle . \\ntarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough's legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any tarzan adventure so far . \\nbadly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves . \\ni have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it's not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie . \\nfurthermore , it's even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence . \\nand , while i'm not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production . \\nof course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the film's troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line . \\nimagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor , and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like . \\nwith its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences , the film barely registers a pulse . \\nanyone in search of a relatively entertaining , family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book , which uses the same basic elements to much better effect . \\nthe only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which , unfortunately , includes the two lead actors ) . \\nthe film doesn't attempt to re-tell the origin story ? the thinking is that it has been done often enough . \\ninstead , tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a . k . a . john clayton a . k . a . tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march ) . \\nhe is living happily in england , enjoying the benefits of being a land-owning noble . \\nmeanwhile , in central africa , the dastardly nigel ravens ( steven waddington ) , a self-proclaimed scholar and explorer , believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar , which he calls the cradle of civilization . \\non the way there , he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things , like burning native villages , to earn the wrath of the locals . \\none shaman , determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal , sends a mystical message to tarzan for help . \\nwith lady jane following close behind , he returns to the jungle where he was born . \\nits patently obvious that casper van dien ( one of the pretty-boy heroes of starship troopers ) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability . \\nwith his plastic facial expressions , monotone voice , and complete inability to make convincing animal noises , his range rivals that of steven seagal . \\nhis pecs , however , are impressive , and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off . \\njane march , on the other hand , has to keep her shirt on , which may be a first for her . \\nsome six years ago , march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud's steamy the lover . \\nsince then , she made the career-killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night , which exploited her every acting defiency . \\ntarzan continues this trend . \\nmarch may be attractive , but , at least judging by this performance , she can't act . \\nmeanwhile , steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy . \\ninstead , he turns out to be little more than a nuisance . \\nthe story line is pure formula , which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies . \\nthe problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless . \\nthe romantic elements are all contrived ? in fact , lady jane's presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance . \\nthe special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel ( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes ? apparently , animatronics were too expensive for this production ) . \\nand , of course , as with all jungle movies , there are the obligatory cute animals . \\nover the years , the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material . \\nthe most famous ape man was johnny weismuller , but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part ( including gordon scott , who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role ) . \\nweismuller made 12 tarzan features ; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number . \\nand , having seen tarzan and the lost city , i would argue that the movie-going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 . \\n\",\n",

one should start each day considering oneself as dead . \\nliving atop an abandoned building , surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons , ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends . \\nhe craves nothing more . \\nas he puts it late in the film , \" i\\'ve seen all i want to see . \" \\nhe exists in a spiritual world of the mind , gaining moral sustenance from his readings . \\nghost dog wasn\\'t always as he is presented . \\nin several roshomon-like flashbacks , it\\'s shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan , that \" samaritan \" being a foot soldier in an aging crime family . \\nghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man , louie ( tormey ) , as repayment . \\nafter years of loyal service , ghost dog is sent , by louie , to kill \" handsome frank \" , a made man within louie\\'s organization who has run away with the crime boss\\'s daughter , louise ( vessey ) . \\nghost dog wordlessly executes his task , witnessed by louise , whom he spares , as she sits watching a betty boop cartoon , clutching a copy of the book , roshomon . \\nin a bit of synchronicity , louise loans the book to ghost dog . \\nupset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family , the mob bosses , in turn , put out a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade . \\nthe rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict . \\nthe theme of old cartoons flares up time and again , each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dog\\'s world . \\neach time a character is shown watching a cartoon , it\\'s from the same era , betty boop , felix the cat , etc . , a reflection of days gone by . \\nnear the end , louise is watching a cartoon that\\'s a departure from the previously shown ones . \\nit\\'s a bit of audacity on jarmusch\\'s part that is nicely effective , despite it\\'s surrealistic nature . \\nas ghost dog floats through his world , his life is touched by two people . \\none is a sage little girl ( winbush ) who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading . \\nshe comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways and new sensibilities , just as louise ultimately does . \\nby film\\'s end , the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer . \\nthe other person in ghost dog\\'s world is an ice cream ( de bankole\\' ) vendor who only speaks french , yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog . \\nthe vendor is the literal stranger in a strange land . \\njarmusch , through rapper/composer rza , underscores his film with rap and reggae music , which at first blush seems dichotomous , but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie . \\nghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars . \\n ( which , in and of itself , presents another paradox about ghost\\'s dog\\'s sense of honor . ) \\nthe head mafioso is played by henry silva with a stone faced resignation . \\nof all the cartoonish mobsters , he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world . \\ngorman plays sonny , a lieutenant who respects the old ways , yet has a quirky affinity for rap music , a love comically shown in several impromptu displays . \\nruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia . \\nhe is a husk of a man , assisted by two hearing aids , who barks out advice without truly hearing what he , or others are saying . \\nwhitaker carries the film by using what truly great actor\\'s use , his face . \\nghost dog is reticent to speak , often going for long periods without doing so . \\nthe fact that whitaker can convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look is a remarkable talent . \\nalthough the film has a deliberate pace , some of the late night drives and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down . \\ntruly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob . \\nhe reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world . \\ncarried on the shoulders of a remarkable performance by whitaker , ghost dog rises beyond being a characterization or icon , into a figure that garners sympathy , if not a bit of pity . \\n',\n",

       " b\"no , it is not a bad film , in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose , i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly . \\nevent horizon is not your run-of-the-mill sci-fi film , i'm sure many who have watched this will agree with me . \\nit is not even original in that sense , and it does borrow heavily from films like alien , hellraiser and even blade runner . \\nthe magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build-up that makes it wonderfully horrifying . \\nthe story brings us to the year 2050 , where space travel have since enormously progressed . \\nthe event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose ; it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man's lifetime . \\nthe ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years , it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune . \\na search and rescue team led by miller ( fishburne ) is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon . \\nthe designer of the ship , dr . weir ( neill ) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship . \\nevent horizon is a sci-fi horror film , much truer to the word than say , alien would ever be . \\nwhile in alien , the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces , in event horizon , the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying . \\nthe story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb , up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud `enough ! \\ni can't stand this anymore ! ' . \\nthere are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime . \\nthe story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also , the acting is only at most , average by most commercial standards . \\neven so , the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film , thanks to its well-paced storytelling , disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences ( which incidentally , has been quite generously removed by our censorship board ) . \\ndirector paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of `atmosphere' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror' . \\nthis picture did not do very well in the us box-office most probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this . \\nalthough on the face of it , event horizon is mostly molded for mass-entertainment ; many thrills , spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus . \\nhowever , the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing . \\nmy friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the `experience' of event horizon . \\ni guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us . \\nbe forewarned , this film is not for the faint-hearted nor for pure entertainment . \\nbe prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film ! \\nevent horizon is highly recommended ? ? but at your own risk ! \\nit has been a long time since good-horror embraced the big screen , and event horizon is one . \\n\",\n",
       " b\"starring shawnee smith ; donovan leitch ; ricky paull goldin ; kevin dillon & billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960's classic ( a term that i use very loosely to define the original ) about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way . \\nnow the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel . \\nthe fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesn't exactly hurt it either . \\nfast forward to the late '80's . \\nsteve mcqueen isn't in the remake ( this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years ) . \\nnor is there any hollywood heavy hitters in the lead role . \\nthat is unless you count matt dillon's brother kevin as a hollywood heavy hitter . \\nthe other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original . \\nthe only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets . \\nit looks as if the produces of the new blob had a couple of holes in their pockets . \\nthe special effects in this movie are cheesy , like the original's . \\nunlike the original , they don't look campy , they just look cheap . \\none bright spot in the movie from a purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith . \\nshe is very attractive and can actually act , which is more than i can say about some of her costars . \\nin terms of plot , a little ball of pink goop falls from the sky . \\nseems this goop was an experiment that was being housed up on a satellite . \\nanyway , the pink stuff has a taste for humans . \\nthe more people it absorbs , the bigger it gets . \\nand it isn't the friendliest goop on the block either . \\nanyway , it attacks this little town and it's up to the attractive local teenage population to stop it . \\nnot really , but that is how it seems . \\nthis version attempts to recapture the camp of the original . \\nas i've already said , this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap , badly acted , and badly written than campy . \\nin the years since this film was made none of the cast have gone on to greatness . \\nalthough , star shawnee smith had a very tiny role in armageddon . \\nthe reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple -- they all stunk out loud . \\nalthough some of the film's smaller roles are filled with some actors that , while not big stars , are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows . \\nit also appears that the producers of the blob tried to compensate for the lack of a special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible . \\nsadly , it doesn't work very well . \\nif you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town , then i would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original . \\n ( although that isn't so hot either . ) \\nthis newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming qualities . \\n\",\n",
       " b\"it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of today\\x12s movies or novels , you must \\x13suspend disbelief . \\x14 \\nhowever , there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies . \\nit came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg , indiana ( where the film is set ) , does not have a mcdonald's , a sears store , a statue of a man on a horse , nor even a dam close by . \\neven if you can ignore these somewhat \\x13white\\x14 lies ( even though the dam is crucial to hard rain\\x12s plot ) ; there is still a bunch of things that just don\\x12t gel . \\nfirstly , morgan freeman , possibly the greatest actor alive ( after such films as driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption and se7en ) , was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement . \\nhe _should_ have played the town sheriff , an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman . \\nas a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg , its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases . \\ni say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them ; and it seems a tad strange that an entire town ( with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way ) can vanish before the flood has actually started . \\nbut nether the less , armored guard couriers tom ( christian slater ) and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van . \\nwith a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads , it doesn\\x12t take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road . \\njim ( morgan freeman ) and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars . \\nbut of course tom is more than willing to save the day , so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town . \\nthe local sheriff ( randy quaid , whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 ) and a couple of police men investigate the situation , but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he/she would do with their share of the three million dollars . \\ndirector mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy-turvy , and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite \\x13goodies versus baddies , \\x14 there are numerous twists in it\\x12s plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience . \\nbut by the time these interesting changes occur , it\\x12s far too late in the film for them to have much affect . \\nhard rain\\x12s continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had ; and although it\\x12s cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par . \\nnot at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman , we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected . \\nsuch titles as broken arrow ( slater and john travolta ) and face/off ( nicholas cage and john travolta ) come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations . \\nstrangely enough , they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta . \\nwe can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre , but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character . \\nif you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow , my answer would have been a definite no . \\ni now know that he has no excuse , and _can_ do better ( if you don\\x12t believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store ) . \\nalthough hard rain never really works from the start , i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen . \\nthe addition of an enticing sub-plot would have given the film time to breathe , rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that can\\x12t handle anything else . \\ndespite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account , if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film . \\nno creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors , but it doesn\\x12t really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about $8 . 50 is compare this to other films . \\n\",\n",

       " b\"disconnect the phone line . \\ndon't accept the charges . \\ndo anything you can to avoid the wretched , melodramatic sisterhood dramedy `hanging up' . \\ni figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side , and `hanging up' seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so . \\nthe film features an incredible palate of female talent , and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as `sleepless in seattle' and `unsung heroes' . \\nmeg ryan , diane keaton and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who , once separated by career judgments over family ties , must reunite when their father ( walter matthau ) is admitted into the hospital with alzheimer's disease . \\nwhile this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past , the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating , shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery . \\n`hanging up' has the overall effect of a tele-marketer pestering you for two hours , while you don't have the option of doing as the title suggests . \\nfor the first half-hour , the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development . \\nthis is an annoying and ineffective device . \\ncell-phones ring every five minutes , and everyone hurriedly rushes along , leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters' issues and problems . \\nif `hanging up' was an apple pie , then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story . \\ngranted , there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film . \\nbut they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck . \\nthe most outrageous strategy in `hanging up' is that , after a series of largely unrealized attempts at character development , we are expected to exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale . \\nwe are able to identify with eve ( ryan ) , the most open and caring daughter , because she is the one who stayed by her father's side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career . \\ngeorgia ( keaton ) , the eldest daughter , is celebrating the fifth year anniversary of her magazine called . . . . \\n`georgia' . \\nmaddy ( kudrow ) , the soap opera actress , spends time either contemplating her possible path to stardom or nursing her dog . \\nryan's convincing performance and diverting cuteness are two of the more agreeable aspects of `hanging up' . \\nkudrow , so delightfully eccentric as the off-kilter airhead phoebe in `friends' , is totally wasted . \\nditto for keaton , who is serving a double shift as co-star and director - a time slot that can be a difficult priority juggle . \\nher frenzy is apparent . \\nfor a chick flick , there is a distressing lack of chuckles . \\nthe reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that , given his character's situation , seems more depressing than amusing . \\neven so , the peak form of humor in `hanging up' is represented by some of matthau's nasty quips and ryan's eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a pill . \\nthat about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film . \\nmy curiosity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how such a promising and star-studded approach could turn so viciously sour . \\nbut really , it's no mystery . \\nthe predictable , melodramatic filth that is `hanging up' is certainly not the fault of these actresses . \\npin it on the screenplay , which attempts to clear up vital issues in three or four minutes , while spending the rest of the running time in an annoying flurry of phone conversations . \\nit's certainly a far cry from what one would label as a rewarding experience , but `hanging up' should have at least been enjoyable . \\nuh-uh . \\nit's a wrong number from the beginning . \\n\",\n",

\\nno ? well , how about sharon stone ? \\nthought so ) . \\nif anything in this film surprises you at all , i would guess you haven\\'t seen that many films . \\nthere is no suspense here . \\ntrust me , i looked hard to find some . \\ni had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations . \\nfincher aim\\'s for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas . \\nthere are those that might say \" the game \" is not intended to be viewed literally . \\ni would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film . \\nthe film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues . \\nthere is a moment early in the film where van orton , realizing his game has begun , smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out who\\'s in on the whole thing . \\nhe is charged by his paranoia . \\nhe is looking at the world through new eyes . \\nit is the last thought-provoking moment in the film . \\nfrom there on , the director only wants to stay a step ahead of us . \\nany significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into a plot device . \\nat the outset , we\\'re told each \" game \" is tailored to the individual . \\nultimately , this \" game \" is supposed to work like a crucible , trying this obscenely wealthy and emotionally detached aristocrat by fire , proving his soul . \\nyet , as douglas endures his personal gauntlet , we\\'re given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is . \\ni wanted to like this film more than i did . \\ni look at it as just anothergreat idea , poorly realized . \\ni can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film didn\\'t mean we were seeing what was really happening . \\nbryan singer\\'s \" the usual suspects \" for one , a film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas . \\nalso , there is the underrated \" jacob\\'s ladder , \" with tim robbins , a film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism . \\nhere are two examples of films that don\\'t simply manipulate for manipulations\\' sake . \\nthere are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to a meaningful place . \\none major issue that comes up in \" the game \" is whether or not the whole \" illusion \" is just a highly sophisticated con game . \\nwell , i can tell you right now , after you\\'ve spent your $7 dollars , you may be asking yourself the same thing . \\n',\n",

       " b'historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s . \\nfor many critics , scholars and , most importantly , film producers , it was a thing of the past - something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black-and-white television and non-cgi special effects . \\nbut in 1995 , same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago , there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor , producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre . \\nand , same as in the case of dances with wolves , he was awarded for his effort with \" oscars \" . \\nthe name of the film was braveheart , and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson . \\nthe plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 ) . \\nin his time , english king edward i \" longshanks \" ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles , including scotland , whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by \" ius primae noctis \" and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights . \\nalthough english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesn\\'t care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack ) . \\nmurron\\'s death changes that and wallace takes arms and , together with small but dedicated band of followers , begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country . \\nthrough time , more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace\\'s rag-tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge . \\nbut the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who wouldn\\'t like to have a simple commoner as a national leader . \\nbraveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson , so it wouldn\\'t be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann . \\nhowever , even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre . \\nthe most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism . \\nwhile older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale-like vision of picturesque castles , splendid costumes and knights in shining armour , gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard , short and brutish . \\nthis general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle , where hand-to-hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details , never seen since verhoeven\\'s ultra-naturalistic flesh & blood . \\ncompared with this naturalistic approach , most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays . \\nbraveheart also employs humour at the right places , not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences , but also to underline its down-to-earth atmosphere , so different from previous historical epics . \\nwhat makes braveheart \" larger than life \" is his protagonist . \\nmel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and , as a result , character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero . \\nwallace is more than superior to his enemies , both physically and mentally , yet he is able to show his sensitive , more vulnerable side . \\nnaturally , when the character is based on epic poems , most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s ) . \\nhowever , even those who don\\'t particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace , especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child . \\nbecause of that the disbelief is hardly suspended , and final scenes aren\\'t as effective as they should be . \\nmel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful , and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors . \\nmost memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan , whose cold , calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema . \\nbrendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boorman\\'s general ) is also very good as wallace\\'s trusted companion , as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy-stricken king john balliol . \\ndavid o\\'harra is very entertaining as wallace\\'s irish ally , and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience-stricken character of robert the bruce . \\nwomen in this film have rather thankless roles , especially marceau as one-dimensional french princess . \\ncatherine mccormack as wallace\\'s wife was more interesting , but she was eliminated from the picture early on . \\nfrom the technical point of view , the film is also very good . \\nphotography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen . \\non the other hand , the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern-day instruments for period piece set in medieval times . \\nalthough mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike , braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism . \\nthe main reason for that was the fact that gibson , among many historical facts , chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of \" longshank \" \\'s son prince edward ( played by peter hanly ) . \\nhe is not only presented as a villain , but also as one of the less competent in villain\\'s camp - and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in \" politically correct \" hollywood . \\nto make things even more obvious , good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward - rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives\\' common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals . \\nhowever , although the message of this film might look right-wing , it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century . \\naccording to that ideology , oppressed classes ( workers , peasants ) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and , as such , they are more radical , less willing to make compromises and more efficient ; on the other hand , privileged classes ( aristocracy , bourgeoisie ) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges . \\nthis marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety . \\nin the end , whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic , braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre . \\n',\n",
       " b'after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy , i was ready for some mindless fun--oh , maybe something like tango & cash . \\nmaybe not ! \\nmindless fun is one thing , but brain-dead slop is another matter altogether . \\ntango & cash has \" lowest common denominator \" written all over it . \\nthe movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l . a . russell plays cash , a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts . \\nstallone plays tango , a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it ; he doesn\\'t need the money . \\nin an effort to change his image , stallone goes for a yuppie , gq look in the film , wearing spectacles and three piece suits . \\nthe two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names . \\ntango & cash is unbearably noisy . \\nfor starters , there\\'s harold faltermeyer\\'s annoying synthesized score , which gets old after four notes . \\nto make matters worse , the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars , the more the merrier . \\nin fact , the movie begins with not one but two car chases . \\nthere\\'s nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie . \\nscreenwriter randy feldman\\'s brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv . \\nhis shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it , such as stallone\\'s efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual . \\nin a movie with the iq level of an amoeba , even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligent--and stallone is no lawrence olivier . \\nit\\'s hard to imagine anyone reading feldman\\'s script and thinking , \" i want to be in this movie . \" \\nthe film\\'s plot doesn\\'t have one original bone in its body , and--again--you have to point your finger at the screenwriting . \\nfeldman\\'s story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book , making tango & cash altogether generic and predictable . \\nthey simply could have called it \" action movie . \" \\nevery character , every twist and turn , is stolen from television or from other movies . \\nadding insult to injury , tango & cash is about as believable as a \" road runner \" cartoon . \\naction movies don\\'t have to be realistic , but they should absorb you enough so that you\\'re not thinking about the lack of realism . \\nthe only artistic aspect of tango & cash is the cinematography . \\nthere are some spectacular shots , especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires . \\nthe film\\'s main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell . \\nunfortunately , their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants . \\nthe dialogue consists of nothing but one-liners , and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing . \\nit\\'s a shame because with a workable screenplay , russell and stallone could have turned tango & cash into a charming \" lethal weaponesque \" adventure . \\ntango & cash tries to maintain a light tone , and you do laugh about once every five minutes . \\nseeing russell in drag is the movie\\'s funniest moment , but you probably already have seen it in the commercials . \\nfurthermore , the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence . \\nmachine guns and torture generally don\\'t mix well with comedy . \\njack palance appears in tango & cash doing what he does best : playing a sleazy , conniving villain . \\nhis character , however , is run-of-the-mill , except for his strange obsession with mice . \\nlike many movie villains , palance likes to play games . \\nin fact , he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash , a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room . \\nyou have to wonder why palance doesn\\'t just shoot the detectives in the head ! \\nthe story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent . \\nteri hatcher plays stallone\\'s sister and russell\\'s love-interest , and she is just as pretty as can be . \\nbut regrettably , hatcher\\'s acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty . \\nevery time she opens her mouth , you cringe ; corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination . \\nthere\\'s really very little , if anything , to recommend in the film . \\nand , more to the point , tango definitely isn\\'t worth a penny of your cash--so don\\'t bother . \\n',\n",

       " b'i didn\\'t come into city of angels expecting greatness . \\ni\\'ve never seen wim wenders\\' wings of desire , the classic movie upon which city is loosely based . \\nthen again , i have seen enough stories which are based upon a similar plot device , with the little mermaid ( both the disney version and the original folktale ) being among them , that i had some high expectations about the possible power such a story of impossible love can hold . \\nunfortunately , city of angels ended up fulfilling few of them . \\nthe plot , for those that couldn\\'t tell from the previews , revolves around the angel seth , played with an almost creepy intensity by nicolas cage , who , in the midst of his angelic duties , falls in love with a heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan in her most endearing performance since when harry met sally ) . \\nof course , his being an angel prevents him from doing much about his love except appearing at random times to talk to her , watch her buy groceries , only to disappear in the blink of an eye . \\ntheir love must remain unrequited unless seth decides to make the ultimate sacrifice and become human . \\nusing this framework as a jumping-off point , the movie attempts to veer through some heavy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire , the joys of being human , and the definition of perfection . \\nthe first half of the movie succeeds on most points . \\ncage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who doesn\\'t know feelings so can\\'t really express , preventing the character of seth from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of intent looks and hang-dog expressions . \\nunfortunately , cage takes the intensity too far sometimes , and then seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive . \\nas maggie , ryan manages to be convincing as a heart surgeon who has trouble coming to terms with her having lost a patient on the operating table despite having done everything right . \\nher beauty , unlike her unbearable cuteness in french kiss , is mature , intelligent , and winning . \\nlikewise , some interesting ideas float around at the beginning of the film . \\nwhen the camera pans through traffic jams and libraries and we get to hear the thoughts of the random people who flash across the screen , the audience experiences a little of what it must be like to be an angel . \\nthe beautiful camera work , shooting down onto the hectic world of los angeles from the improbable perches of the angels , also gives us a sense of the unique wonder angels feel . \\nthe film begins to lose its way , though , when the focus tightens more and more on seth and maggie . \\nthe grand , angelic perspective gets lost , except for some idly tossed lines about the incredible beauty of the world through an angel\\'s eyes . \\nthe movie devolves into an examination of how seth can\\'t feel the world or , more importantly , he can\\'t feel maggie : he can\\'t smell her hair , feel her touch , or taste the pears she eats . \\nthis change in focus attempts to capture the audience in seth\\'s intense longing , but in doing so , the conflict disappears . \\nif he wants maggie so badly , then why doesn\\'t her just make the leap and become human ? \\nafter all , what\\'s so great about being an angel ? \\nsure , you get to sit on marlboro signs , but what\\'s that compared to getting to be with meg ryan ? \\nand from there , once the yearning has been established and the romantic denouement must occur , it\\'s all downhill . \\nthe philosophy becomes heavy-handed , the dialogue pedestrian when it tries to be deep , and the plot twists simply attempt to yank a few more tears into the audience\\'s hankie . \\nit\\'s the last thirty minutes of the movie , then , that wrecks the film . \\ni feel like the writer , by pulling out all the melodramatic stops , has robbed me of what could have been a genuinely powerful movie experience on both the romantic and the philosophical level . \\ni came out feeling robbed , seeing so much possibility in a film becoming nothing . \\ni could go on longer , but i don\\'t want to \" ruin \" the end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices the film relies on . \\ncity of angels , then , is a paradox . \\nit\\'s a well-acted ( particularly look for dennis franz cutting against type-casting as a happy-go-lucky fallen angel ) , well-filmed , and based on a wonderful idea . \\nall these possibilities , though , are what make the film so unredeemable when the closing credits come up . \\n',\n",

       " b\"it's no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office . \\na poorly-written script can be bested by a superb acting corps , and a well-written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs . \\nin directing his latest action-comedy , director brett ratner ( money talks ) takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all get-out buddy cop movie . \\nin addition , rush hour serves as a first-class example of directing a movie with conservative attitude - a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types . \\nthe two lead names share equal screen time here , mostly because they spend it together . \\njackie chan , in his first completely american production , makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts . \\nthe other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago , knock off , stands no chance against the content of this one . \\nchan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise , and there's no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who couldn't believe their eyes the first time . \\nchris tucker , on the opposite side , relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chan's performance . \\nhe works perfectly with the script , and it's quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a hand with some of his lines . \\nalmost essential to the action genre , the plot is nonexistent . \\nwe're quickly introduced to detective james carter ( tucker ) is a maverick officer for the lapd . \\ncut forward to another scene where the daughter ( julia hsu ) of the american chinese consul ( tzi ma ) is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters . \\nthe fbi is quick to the rescue , but the consul insists that one of his men , detective inspector lee ( chan ) , be brought on the case to help . \\nthe fbi resists , but then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective . \\nit's here that carter and lee hook up , and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up . \\nrattner does a fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up , but it doesn't quite reach the top tier of action-comedies like last year's grosse pointe blank . \\nthere are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to , and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan , this might be a major drawback . \\nalso , some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride , and others are there simply to look menacing . \\nhowever , none gives a standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background . \\nalmost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another - whether it's tucker's toned-down routine or chan's tight rein on his action sequences - and that contributes greatly to this being a watchable movie for all types . \\na recommendable visit to the theater , indeed . \\n\",\n",

       " b'vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element , substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject , but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents . \\nand , unlike any of the more outlandish myths , the vampire holds some real-world probability ( one study claims 1 , 000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide , and places 50 in los angeles ) . \\nbut lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys , john carpenter would like to remind us that they are - and always have been - a truly frightening element of the thriller genre . \\nand remind us he does in his latest film , vampires . \\nthere was some question , as halloween weekend approached , of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinema\\'s immensely successful blade , released in august . \\nthe two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue , and don\\'t even agree on some basic points of the slaying method . \\n ( for instance , blade\\'s main weapons are silver and garlic , whereas main character jack crow\\'s technique is a wooden stake to the heart . ) \\nblade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization , while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate . \\nboth have their advantages , and here , carpenter\\'s style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered . \\nwhen it\\'s all said and done , though , the vampires still kill and die with a bloody flourish ; the level for gore is indeed set to maximum . \\nthis time , our hero is vatican-sponsored slayer jack crow ( james woods ) . \\nhe\\'s a cynical , battle-worn veteran , and the best of his bunch . \\nhe and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest , and after exterminating a nest one night , they run up against a super-vampire ( termed a \" master \" ) named valek ( thomas ian griffith ) . \\nvalek kills all of jack\\'s team except for his partner , tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and as the two regroup , they learn that valek is the original vampire - now over six hundred years old . \\napparently , valek and his minions have been sweeping the southwest for decades in search of a cross that will enable them to walk in the daytime . \\nso with the aid of a priest named adam ( tim guinee ) and a bitten hooker ( sheryl lee ) as bait , they track valek down for the final confrontation . \\nthe script for vampires , written by don jakoby and based on the john steakley novel , is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay to see production all year . \\ncrow , in particular , is a fun source of one-liners , and woods does every one of them with perfect stoicism . \\nbaldwin , lee , and guinee are all fine supports , adding to the character pool , but the other true highlight of the movie is thomas ian griffith\\'s bad guy . \\ngriffith\\'s intense expression is perfect for the role , and the only downside is that he\\'s got to talk sometime . \\nluckily , he\\'s got few lines , and manages to pull off a rather thrilling performance . \\nall said , fans will surely be impressed by this picture , and those who found apt pupil a bit limp will be excited by this one . \\ncertainly a worthwhile visit to the theaters . \\n',\n",

       " b' \" america\\'s sweethearts \" has an intriguing premise and a great cast , but it isn\\'t nearly as edgy or funny as it should be . \\nalmost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer billy crystal , who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co-hosting \" comic relief \" charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self-indulgence ) . \\ncrystal ignores a simple , but crucial , rule : for a screwball comedy to work , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous . \\n \" america\\'s sweethearts \" takes place at a press junket , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters . \\nit\\'s a promising set-up , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules , thus dissipating the tension of the situation . \\nby the end of the film , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed . \\njohn cusack and catherine zeta-jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison , a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector ( hank azaria ) , a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp . \\nof the last nine films eddie and gwen made together , six crossed the $100 million mark , but the prospects for their final effort , a space opus titled \" time over time , \" are far from rosy . \\nwhile eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup , gwen\\'s solo films have tanked . \\nto make matter worse , the director of the movie ( christopher walken ) , a \" visionary \" who purchased the unabomber\\'s cabin and had it moved to his backyard , is withholding the film from the studio , insisting that the first screening be held at the junket . \\ndesperate to win over the press , the studio elects to hire lee ( billy crystal ) , a recently fired publicist , to salvage the situation . \\nlee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation . \\nhe enlists the help of kiki ( julia roberts ) , gwen\\'s sister , personal assistant and whipping girl . \\nwhat lee doesn\\'t know is that kiki is in love with eddie , a fact that could temper her effectiveness . \\npress junkets are a haven for control freaks . \\nstudios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel , with food and drink always at hand . \\ngenerally , on the evening of their arrival , writers are bussed to see the featured film , then ferreted straight back to the hotel . \\nthe next day , writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews . \\nevery 30 minutes or so , a producer , director , writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions , with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things . \\nthe atmosphere is one of cordial oppression ? writers are free to ask what they want , but understand that if the studio dislikes a question , they may not be invited to future junkets . \\nrepresentatives from tv stations face even more restrictions . \\nthey get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew , with the studio filming the exchanges . \\nthe \" reporters \" are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars , but to play it safe , the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs . \\nplacing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired , but the screenplay undermines the conceit . \\nthe junket is moved from the handsome , but highly confining , four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas . \\nfor most of the film , the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds , completely safe from the eyes of the press . \\nwhen they do deal with journalists , the \" it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters \" premise is de-clawed . \\ngwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll , they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and , at the screening of the movie , everyone connected with the film goes nuts , all without any repercussions . \\nlee certainly isn\\'t bothered by any of the infantile outbursts ; in fact , he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids . \\nis the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors ? \\nhell no ? they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie . \\nall of which underscores how billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise : the comedy in \" america\\'s sweethearts \" is based on barely-in-control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters , except that it doesn\\'t matter because any publicity is good publicity . \\nand thus the very set-up for the film implodes , leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter . \\nso what about the cast ? \\njulia roberts , at her best playing the underdog , is utterly charming here , although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit ( and not a very convincing one , by the way ) . \\ncatherine zeta-jones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic . \\nby casting himself as the publicist , billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on \" comic relief \" - stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks . \\nin supporting roles , hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed \" too broad . \" \\nseth green is amusing as a toadie , stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair , though he has little to work with . \\ncome to think of it , \" little to work with \" is the operative phrase for this movie . \\nas a hollywood satire , \" america\\'s sweethearts \" is toothless . \\nas a romance , it is at best a minor pleasure . \\nsuch a good cast , such a waste of their efforts . \\nhad it not been taken long ago , a better title for the film would have been \" much ado about nothing . \" \\n',\n",

       " b'john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles . \\nso effortlessly that people tend to forget he\\'s there , much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors ( anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor\\'s face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors ) . \\nexample : the other day my mother asked me ( the expert , of course ) if there were any movies out worth seeing , never mind that our tastes couldn\\'t be more divergent--- i\\'ll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes , and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go ! \\nwas a lot of fun ( which it is ) , so i didn\\'t see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation . \\ni muttered , with a little trepidation , that she might enjoy high fidelity . \\nshe responded with her usual query , \" whose in that one ? \" \\nthis is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see . \\nif the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light , a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing , and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people ( usually of the jewish faith ) fretting about in some upper east side palace . \\nanyway , when i answered \" john cusack \" , she replied with a rather stunned \" who ? \" , as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to . \\nnow i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies , most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin , but i suppose it\\'s understandable that she would not recognize the name , after all , for most , names are tougher than faces . \\ni showed her a picture of cusack\\'s mug in the paper hoping for an \" oh - him , yes he\\'s quite good \" instead i got a \" no - i don\\'t know him \" . \\nat this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger ( yes , filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone ) , till i realized something : i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack\\'s relatively bland visage , or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise , one-syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car . \\ncu-sack . cu-sack - no , not quite as cool . \\ni\\'m sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as \" the guy from ( add in the cusack film of your choice ) \" . \\nhe\\'s not a brand name , and his movies usually aren\\'t big moneymakers , but in his own unassuming way he\\'s kind of a genius . \\nwith his pleasant , common man looks , and charming semi-articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90\\'s . \\nfrom the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon . \\ndespite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it ( the schlumpy every man ) , he\\'s a constantly enjoyable screen persona , like albert brooks or woody allen . \\nand he knows how to chose scripts , while the stephan baldwin\\'s and val kilmer\\'s seem to put them selves in everything ( the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle , and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent ) , cusack generally picks rewarding projects ( save for the unwatchable hot pursuit , a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller ) . \\nhigh fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears ( the grifters , the hi-lo country ) , and it\\'s a hit . \\nit was also co-written by cusack , and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy , grosse point blank . \\nit\\'s not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film , but as it progresses in its meandering fashion , the movie cast something of a spell over me . \\nhigh fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non-committal rob , a vinyl record store owner , who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his \" top 5 break ups list \" . \\nthis is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller\\'s day off . \\nat first the talking-directly-into-the-camera-schtick had me vaguely annoyed , mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit , but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack\\'s witty delivery . \\nhe\\'s the kind of guy we don\\'t mind talking directly to us . \\ngradually the film settles into a shampoo-like tragi-comic character study , of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is ( yes it\\'s all very existential ) . \\nthough that plot-line is mostly enjoyable , the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters , all of whom ( now this is really something ) are terrific enough to warrant their own films . \\nthe best of which is jack black ( of the very funny show tenacious d , a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis\\' hair ? ? ? unfortunately that annoying smirk remains ) , an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy . \\nhe\\'s the kind of guy i\\'m sure we\\'ve all met before , a blowhard who thinks he\\'s always right and will do anything in his power ( be it yell , argue , insult ) to hoist his opinion onto others . \\nbut i like this guy , because of how black plays him . \\nthe actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes , but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak ( which might be a bit of a redundant description , seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic ) . \\nhe\\'s the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films . \\n ( look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister ) . \\nbut fears and black never let that happen . \\nthe character , for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality . \\nhe\\'s over the top , but in a way we can all probably relate to . \\ncatherine zeta-jones , in her brief role , gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own \" charm \" . \\ntim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age-type , a character played entirely for cartoon yuks , but still manages to work its desired comic effect . \\nthe one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy , the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle ( mifune ) , who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent , replacing it with a stilted american phonation . \\ni give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role , but instead of being likeable , she comes across as rather robotic , and as such it\\'s hard to see why cusack\\'s character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful , intelligent writer ( natasha gregson wagner ) potentially waiting in the wings . \\nthis reminded me of say anything , where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye , and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood ( whose unbelievably more wooden then father , clint for those \" special people \" whose wheels turn a little slower ) . \\nin fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his , though i\\'d bet that if laura and natasha switched roles , the result would be more effective . \\nhigh fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances . \\nfears\\' direction is somewhat stilted , and the script is sometimes a little too ( and this is a word i\\'m beginning to hate to use but alas i must ) quirky for its own good ( i think i\\'ll blame that on scott rosenberg , who judging from what he did with beautiful girls , con air , and things to do in denver while your dead , has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie ) . \\nbut cusack really does deserve an award , for being so damn ? ? ? cusackian . \\ni\\'m afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent . \\nhis character , rob ( whose sort of like an older , more bitter lloyd from say anything ) is funny and tragic without being pathetic , and that cusack can do all this , and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences , is something of an achievement . \\n',\n",
       " b\"the laserman : somehow the title of writer-director-producer peter wang's film conjures up images of superheroes , like ultraman and spiderman . \\nyou kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips . \\nas it turns out , the laserman _is_ about crime and about laser beams , but there aren't any superheroes . \\ninstead , wang's film is populated by a group of refreshingly off-beat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot : new york city . \\nthe laserman is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity , eccentricity , and electricity . \\nthe film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss ( marc hayashi ) , a chinese-american laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment . \\nhe loses his job but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds . \\narthur's professional life is cluttered with moral dilemmas . \\nhis personal life , on the other hand , is cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives . \\nin fact , arthur is by far the blandest character in the film , despite a charismatic performance by hayashi ( the san francisco-based actor whose films include chan is missing and the karate kid ii ) . \\nit's the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark . \\narthur's not-so-typical jewish mother , ruth , for example , is convinced that a chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body . \\nshe has dyed her red hair black , she takes herbal medicine daily , and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies , such as matzo balls in soy sauce--the ultimate fusion of jewish and chinese cuisine . \\nveteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part and runs with it , almost stealing the movie in the process . \\nshe plays ruth as a driven woman , determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself in chinese culture . \\narthur's girlfriend janet ( maryann urbano ) is a kooky free-spirit who would rather meditate than copulate ; her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation . \\narthur's best friend , joey ( tony leung ) , is a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns . \\njoey is married to arthur's jewish sister , but he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house . \\narthur's 11-year-old son , jimmy , played by the amazingly adorable david chan , is--horror of horrors--bad at math ! \\nhe finds it impossible to meet his father's lofty expectations . \\nthe various people in arthur's life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity . \\nlike wang's earlier film , a great wall ( about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china ) , the laserman revolves around cultural differences . \\nevery character in the film is , in some way or another , trying to find his identity--struggling to negotiate a balance between his native culture and the american way . \\nthe movie also offers a provocative look at technology . \\nwang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu , a detective who is fed up with machines , even though he relies on them to do his job . \\nthe film views technology with a wary eye , acknowledging its necessity while at the same time realizing its potential dangers . \\nwang raises the time-honored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions . \\nwas einstein responsible for the a-bomb ? \\nis arthur weiss responsible for his lasers ? \\nthe movie pits spirituality against technology , man against machine , and the result is a draw . \\naccording to the film , technology has its place , but we must employ it with great forethought and caution . \\nironically , by its very nature , the laserman is a triumph of technology--the technology of filmmaking . \\nwang's direction is exquisite , especially during the tense finale in which the director frantically cross-cuts between the various subplots , perhaps in homage to d . w . \\ngriffith . \\ncinematographer ernest dickerson , who has worked on all of spike lee's films , gives the laserman a distinctive , artistic look . \\nmason daring's score , which includes a send-up of bach , is right on target . \\nthe laserman is an ambitious endeavor , which is to be applauded , but it's sometimes ambitious to a fault . \\nwang serves up so many slices of life in the film that it's hard to digest them all . \\nfor instance , one character ( arthur's sister ) has negligible screen time , and consequently we just don't care about her marital problems . \\nin weaving his web , wang has included a few too many strands . \\noverall , however , the laserman is a charmingly eclectic concoction . \\non the surface , the film is a light and bouncy comedy-thriller , overflowing with whimsical humor and visual style . \\nthe heavier issues emerge only when you take a deeper look at the film . \\nyou can ponder the moral questions or you can just sit back and enjoy the absurdity of life in china town . \\n\",\n",

       " b'i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool . \\ni spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage , grousing to myself about its transparently planes , trains and automobiles plot machinations , and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement . \\nthis was a mass market romantic comedy , after all , a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and , even in its best days , worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm . \\nthen marc lawrence did something wonderful , something which made the entire film click into place : he showed me a comic love story about grown-ups . \\nit certainly didn\\'t look that way from the outset , which introduces groom-to-be ben holmes ( ben affleck ) at his bachelor party , surrounded by friends and family whooping over his \" last night of freedom . \" \\nben loves his fiancee bridget ( maura tierney ) , but the doom-and-gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this \\'till death do you part business . \\nthen , on an ill-fated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah , ben meets sarah lewis ( sandra bullock ) , a free-spirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her . \\nas transportation troubles thwart them at every turn , ben and sarah begin a three-day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger , ben seeing in sarah the chances he\\'s never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability she\\'s never had . \\nforces of nature gets off to a solid enough start , setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue . \\nben is an ideal role for affleck\\'s easy-going charm , and he plays the straight-laced straight man without forced exasperation . \\nsandra bullock , for her part , is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half-dozen films combined , avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping . \\nthe two performances -- part of a great top-to-bottom cast -- are effective and connected from the start , yet the script\\'s apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely . \\nlively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis , forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self-justification . \\nthe kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose , leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution . \\nforces of nature isn\\'t about a man developing a fear of commitment ; it\\'s about a man learning what commitment means _to him_ , learning that it\\'s not what he thought it was . \\nlawrence\\'s script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending , an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense . \\nearlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance , and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine . \\nthough one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film , and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples , forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you\\'ll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom . \\nthat is , provided you\\'re not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes . \\nfor a brisk romantic comedy , forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over-directed scenes of the year : teetering hand-held shots , why-not low or high angles , sweeping pans . \\noccasionally the hyper-real approach works , with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance ; far more often , hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is , covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can\\'t find what\\'s underneath . \\na script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director , but even hughes\\' excesses can\\'t spoil this unique concoction . \\nforces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant , something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents . \\n',\n",

\\nyes . \\ndoes it matter ? \\nnot really . \\nthe film opens in october of 1969 . \\nfirefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson ) . \\nthe double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective . \\na strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in \\'69 and that john has found in the present day . \\nthough both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom . \\nnow flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women . \\nfrank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past . \\nthe premise of \" frequency \" is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions . \\nthis isn\\'t explained ; you just have to go with it . \\nwhen frank doesn\\'t die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way . \\nthe concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other . \\nsometimes frank\\'s changing the past results in something happening right away in john\\'s world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time . \\nnow , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer\\'s murders was because the change had already happened in frank\\'s world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren\\'t really the point . \\nwhen \" frequency \" gets cooking , it\\'s a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing . \\nwhat matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and \" frequency \" works as long as it keeps moving . \\nthe film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion . \\ndirector gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure \" frequency \" as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved . \\ni liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward . \\nit actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin\\' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john\\'s advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him . \\n ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself . ) \\ni even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods . \\nsome may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let\\'s face it : it\\'s a darn cool way to end the film . \\nthere are enough surprises and plot twists in \" frequency \" to keep you on your toes , and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant . \\nthe other major thing to appreciate about \" frequency \" is the handling of the father-son relationship . \\nquaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it\\'s a rock-solid job from both actors . \\nthe relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ? \\nwatching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question . \\nthe credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don\\'t believe in the characters , we don\\'t care about the outcome of the thriller plot . \\nhere , we do care , because we like the lead actors . \\ni also liked some of the supporting cast members . \\nelizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably . \\nandre braugher , late of the television show \" homicide : life on the street , \" gives a nice supporting turn as frank\\'s best friend and future colleague of john . \\nhe has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank\\'s world series predictions come true before his very eyes . \\nbraugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused . \\nperhaps the only thing i didn\\'t like about \" frequency \" is the overly sentimental coda , during which the camera\\'s focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard . \\nbut that\\'s only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics . \\ni freely acknowledge that \" frequency \" may best work as a \" guy \" movie , since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of father-son relationships ( echoes of \" field of dreams \" can be easily heard ) , but the underlying concept is universally applicable . \\nwho wouldn\\'t want to speak with a long-dead parent ? \\nor see how their children turn out ? \\n \" tell me about your life , son \" -- excuse me while i mist up . \\nand don\\'t call me a sissy . \\n',\n",

       " b'countries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously , had forbidden judges and juries to make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally . \\nluckily , movie reviewers aren\\'t burdened with such legislation . \\notherwise , small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer . \\nin case of star wars , 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas , the consequences would be even more severe , because that film is very special for tens of millions , if not hundreds of millions of fans . \\nin any case , objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews , because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best , if not the best film of all times . \\nthose who don\\'t usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery . \\nthe author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold , objective standards in reviewing this film . \\nlike so many previous reviewers , i must note that i watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago , and that i remained enchanted by the experience ever since . \\nperhaps it was childlike fascination with , until then unimaginable , wonders that happened long time ago , in a galaxy far away . \\nor perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes before the opening shots , with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation i had read before . \\nanyway , watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life . \\nand it was also unmatched for many years to come , because very few movies managed to have such a strong impact on me like george lucas\\' epic . \\nstar wars wasn\\'t just important movie for me ( or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment ) . \\nit was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema . \\nuntil than , american motion picture industry was in a limbo ; social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood , and new authors filled the void , mostly by using hollywood\\'s financial and technical resources to create serious , \" personal \" or \" artsy \" movies . \\nas a result , audience , traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate , didn\\'t want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen . \\ngeorge lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue . \\nthe audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm , and huge financial success of the movie , later backed by supplement industry of toys , books , comics , role playing games and other merchandise , slowly began to change the face of hollywood . \\nserious , adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion , and were replaced by industrial products of \" blockbuster \" philosophy . \\none of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre . \\nuntil 1977 , science fiction movies were mostly in b-production domain . \\nin late 1960s , bigger budgets for science fiction didn\\'t look so strange anymore , thanks to the great success of 2001 : a space odyssey . \\nbut the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism , and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production - mostly dark , dystopic movies . \\nhowever , in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies , even among the audience that usually doesn\\'t like it . \\nas a result , seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away , although some good , dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s . \\nafter that , science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment . \\nironically , the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of \" new hollywood \" generation of young movie authors who made \" artsy \" and \" personal \" films in early 1970s . \\ngeorge lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 , and nostalgic drama american graffiti . \\nboth movies were considered \" personal \" in its time , despite latter one becoming very popular . \\nin a sense , star wars is an also very \" personal \" film , and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it , not for it . \\nbut unlike many \" personal \" movies of the era , its \" personality \" was in line with the wishes of the general audience . \\nthe plot , set \" a long time ago , in a galaxy far away \" , begins in a time of civil war . \\nthe evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic . \\nin order to quash any opposition , the empire had built death star , superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets . \\nthe information about death star , acquired by rebel intelligence , is being transported by princess leia organa ( carrie fisher ) when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser . \\nprincess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader ( played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones ) , but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots - c3po ( anthony daniels ) and r2d2 ( kenny baker ) . \\nthose two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot . \\nhis adventure begins when r2d2 escapes , because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi ( alec guiness ) . \\nold man is actually the last surviving jedi knight , member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force . \\nafter some hesitation , luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess , while the old man would teach him the ways of the force . \\ntheir small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely , where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo ( harrison ford ) and his furry sidekick chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) . \\ncritics who don\\'t like the movie , especially those who can\\'t forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of \" new hollywood \" , are prone to point the lack of originality . \\non the surface , they might be right ; lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood - westerns , wwii aviation movies , old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s ; yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa\\'s samurai classic the hidden fortress . \\non the other hand , those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further - into collective subconscious of western civilisation ( hinted by some mild tolkien references ) . \\nthe others would find the author\\'s element within the story - star wars could be seen as an anti- establishment film ; young , long-haired , easy going , nature-loving heroes are fighting against old , uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes . \\neven out of its historical or social context , star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of the seven art . \\ngeorge lucas\\' direction is very good , with the clever editing and a well-paced segments between action and dramatic buildup . \\ncharacters are well-drawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients , both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster . \\nwe have a \" coming-of-age \" hero , damsel-in-distress ( somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time ) , reluctant helper , benevolent mentor , diabolical villain and , finally , comic relief in form of two non-human characters . \\nsome of the actors are very good - alec guiness in his most famous role to date , james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease , peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form . \\nunfortunately , the same can\\'t be said for the main leads - among the main trio of mark hamill , carrie fisher and harrison ford , only the last one had the character three-dimensional enough to launch his further acting career . \\nthe thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology . \\noften comparisons with 2001 : space odyssey , another ground-breaking sf film , were citing the sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas\\' superiority over kubrick . \\nhowever , the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive , even after two decades ( although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly ) , yet they aren\\'t the most remembered trademark of the movie . \\nthat honour should definitely go to the \" oscar \" -winning soundtrack by john williams , whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career . \\nnewer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release . \\nyet , even if they are immune to the george lucas\\' magic they should watch this film nevertheless , perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture . \\n',\n",

       " b'there is a striking scene early in \" city of angels , \" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise . \\nthe camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black . \\nthen the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up . \\nyou see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch . \\nit is an important scene for several reasons . \\nfirst of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible . \\nthe film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference . \\nthere are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like \" angels in the outfield \" ( 1994 ) or \" michael \" ( 1996 ) . \\nthe angels here are stark and believable . \\nthis early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god\\'s angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air . \\nthere is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well . \\nthey eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven . \\nlike human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure . \\n \" city of angels \" is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan ) . \\nhe first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven . \\nmaggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies . \\nangels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it\\'s not enough . \\nhe wants to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distance . \\nhe learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to \" fall \" and become human . \\nhe learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( \" n . y . p . d . \\nblue \" ) in a touching and humorous performance . \\nsitting at a diner together , franz tells cage\\'s character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food , feel another person\\'s skin , smell the air , and most importantly , have a loving wife and children . \\nof course , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it . \\n \" city of angels \" is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender\\'s haunting 1988 film \" wings of desire . \" \\nwenders\\' film was more like a poem - it was the feeling , the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened . \\nthe americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles , and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human . \\nand , unlike most foreign films that are re-made into hollywood fare , it doesn\\'t suffer extensive damage . \\nthis may be because director brad silberling ( \" casper \" ) and screenwriter dana stevens ( \" blink \" ) wanted to make \" city of angels \" its own movie - inspired by \" wings of desire , \" but not an attempt to copy it . \\nand yet , \" city of angels \" is not a typical hollywood movie . \\nit is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale ( \" the english patient \" ) , whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world . \\nseale creates many striking visuals : in addition to the beach scene , there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around , looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by . \\nwhile the film travels along a charted plot , it takes time to develop its characters and situations ; it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are . \\nboth cage and ryan give soulful , soft-spoken performances . \\nryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch . \\ncage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have . \\nwhat is most striking about \" city of angels \" is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging . \\nit\\'s not a formulaic hollywood ending , because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time . \\nit doesn\\'t give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance . \\ninstead , it offers something much better , something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive . \\n____________________________________________ visit \" charlie don\\'t surf ! \" \\nan eclectic collection of film reviews by james kendrick http : //www . bigfoot . com/~jimkendrick \\n|| e-mail : jimkendrick@bigfoot . com \\n',\n",

       " b'capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence . \\nvisually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver\\'s travels and treat it as an action film . \\nthat makes it a film without much center . \\n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) \\npierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a . k . a . monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire . \\nit reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver\\'s travels . \\nhumans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift\\'s island of the houyhnhnms . \\nthe novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet . \\nit seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that . \\nwhen rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish . \\nthe final irony of the original version has become film history . \\nwithout it there could never have been a \" planet of the apes \" film series . \\ni can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language . \\nin the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language . \\nthat could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking . \\nserling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film . \\njustifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending . \\nbut serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear . \\nfew viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history . \\npartial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith\\'s best if not his best . \\nwhen the film\\'s success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s . \\nwhile the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases . \\nthe series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 . \\nnow director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again . \\nfor those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton\\'s new version is even less faithful . \\nfirst , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes . \\nhe has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes . \\nthat could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes . \\nas with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring . \\nin 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world\\'s most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes . \\nthen a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet . \\n ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . ) \\nhe quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks . \\nand the language they talk is earth- english . \\napparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that . \\nthe fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn\\'t occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film . \\nboth just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english . \\nin any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships . \\noutside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic . \\nleo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter . \\nari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power . \\nshe is bent on making the world a better place . \\nperhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari . \\nin any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film . \\nshe may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward . \\nit is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes . \\nthis is a further abandonment of the source material . \\nthe chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each\\'s place in this reversed society , each important in the book . \\nwe cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down . \\nwe see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them . \\nburton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn . \\nthis is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in . \\nthey are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win . \\nthe 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like \" i never met an ape i didn\\'t like , \" but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character . \\nmost of what this film has to offer is in the visuals . \\nthe visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog . \\nthis tends to limit close looks at the makeup . \\nin general it seems much improved from 1968 . \\nthe makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version . \\nin 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper . \\nit was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion . \\nchambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker . \\ntoday audiences have higher expectations ; baker\\'s visualization is really an improvement . \\nthese visuals work nicely . \\nwhat does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make . \\nthey look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon . \\napes spring incredible distances . \\nsome of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost . \\none final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up . \\nsince the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up . \\nthe one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti . \\nit is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes . \\nbut he delivers them very well . \\nhe was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom . \\nas the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well . \\nin doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen . \\nhe is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov\\'s performance in spartacus . \\nas an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself . \\ndanny elfman\\'s score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith\\'s 1968 tour de force score is a real classic . \\nthat score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten . \\ni rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n',\n",
       " b'ladies and gentlemen , 1997\\'s independence day is here ! \\nit\\'s title : starship troopers . \\nand surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4 . \\ni realize that i gave last year\\'s sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour . \\nafter subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn\\'t as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review . \\nstarship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem . \\nas a result , starship troopers is a

kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether . \\nwhile starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : \" the \\'star wars\\' of the 90s . \" \\nam i being to generous to this film ? \\nperhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races . \\nin essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction . \\nthe easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to . \\nstarship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a \" kick-the-aliens\\'-asses \" style . \\nid4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role . \\nthis new \" star wars \" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs . an alien species . \\nthe alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects . \\nhowever , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy . \\nsometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization . \\nmore than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends . \\nand they should be . \\ni doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film . \\nthis is an \" event \" film , but surprisingly above average . \\nit is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) . \\nstarship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange \" join the army \" ads . \\nmixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original . \\nstating , \" would you like to know more ? \" , \\nthese short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously . \\nhowever , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way . \\nafter witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw . \\nwe are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) . \\nrico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms . \\nhowever , carmen isn\\'t as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot . \\nhowever , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico . \\nunfortunately , rico isn\\'t interested in dizzy . \\nthis setup is rather cliched , as is the result of

unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) . \\nfollowing the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war . \\nthe bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else . \\nmany dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs\\' attacks . \\na sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense . \\nthe troopers are ordered to locate the \" brain \" and capture it . \\ni hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot . \\nit\\'s about special effects and gory violence . \\ndirector verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci-fi days , which gave us good films like total recall . \\nverhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood . \\nstarship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year\\'s event horizon . \\nthe r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it . \\nmy guess is that verhoeven\\'s target audience is the 18 to 25 male group . \\nthe film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women . \\ndespite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful . \\nwhile watching the film , we never second guess the character\\'s decisions because they seem perfectly clear . \\nthankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with . \\nthe cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you . \\ncasper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon . \\nto most guys , he will come across as artificial . \\nfortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character . \\ndina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character . \\nher dizzy is extremely likeable . \\ndenise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done . \\njake busey , gary busey\\'s son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film . \\nneil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast . \\nhowever , he does give a good performance . \\nmichael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm . \\nhis performance rises above the rest . \\nperhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside\\'s presence on screen . \\nunfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star-making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars . \\ndirector verhoeven is the main star of the film . \\nhis direction is fast and unrelentless . \\nhe never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride . \\nwriter edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein . \\nthe writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny . \\nthe dialogue is smart but not too smart . \\nwe aren\\'t required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered . \\nthankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really don\\'t ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while ) . \\namazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues . \\nin fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story . \\nthe moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage . \\ni haven\\'t laughed this loud , even in some comedies . \\noh , and the special effects are first rate . \\nstarship troopers is rated r for graphic sci-fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity . \\nbelieve me when i say this : don\\'t take young kids to see this film . \\nit is extremely violent . \\nin fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year . \\nhowever , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain . \\nit\\'s been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys . \\nand still , it is my dream to see a sci-fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind , and take over the world . \\nnow that would be entertaining ! \\n',\n",
       " b'i\\'m an avid fan of the \" alien \" saga , so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it ) . \\nof course , that doesn\\'t mean that i\\'m gonna be giving this a four-star review or something , because \" alien : resurrection , \" the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is not an absolutely amazing film , much like the first two were . \\nhowever , it\\'s a very good film which never fails to entertain , and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series . \\nin short , i had a good time . \\n \" alien : resurrection \" leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre\\'s answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one . \\nof course , the last one wasn\\'t very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn\\'t financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! ) . \\nso back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that\\'s a bad thing , but it\\'s becoming a cliche ) . \\nso she\\'s cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called \" the auriga \" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr . wren , played by j . e . freeman , as well as the little-seen dr . gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her . \\nonce you get past the fact that you can\\'t figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film\\'s okay . \\nalso on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and . . . winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won\\'t state it , but unless you\\'ve been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it\\'s nicely covered up ) . \\nthere\\'s a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it\\'s never really deepened enough . \\noh well . \\nwell , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship . \\nand it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who\\'s death is comical yet sad since , well , he\\'s dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth . \\nof course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old \" alien \" -brand fun . \\nthe real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there\\'s always a bit of it , most notably in \" aliens \" with the relationship between ripley and the little girl ) . \\nwhat\\'s interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach . \\n \" alien \" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights . \\n \" aliens \" is a wild , tense thriller . \\n \" alien 3 \" is a bleak , moody piece of semi-noir . \\n \" alien 4 \" is kind of like an off-beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares . \\njean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like \" das boot \" has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat . \\nthe chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there\\'s the most tense surgery scene since \" face/off \" towards the beginning ) . \\nand not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that . \\nthis all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others . \\nthere are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed . \\none is the aforementioned surgery scene . \\nanother one takes place between call and ripley , which is just awesome . \\nthe underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw-dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet\\'s earlier film , \" delicatessen \" ) . \\nand the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to \" goldfinger \" ) . \\nbut the best scene in the entire film ( i\\'m sure i\\'m not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an \" 8 \" tatooed on her arm ) . \\nit might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga . \\nthe screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work , as it never really deapens a lot of the characters . \\nhowever , it does make us care about most of them , so that when there\\'s very little of them , and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow , we are pretty scared . \\nand , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley : \" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! \" \\njohner : \" well , i can get you off . \\nbut not this ship . \" ) \\nthe acting is good all around , with stand-out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner , and leland orser ( the poor bastad in \" se7en \" who performed the \" lust \" sin ) as an anxiety-ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him . \\nwinona ryder is good , but not amazing like she usually is ( although she meshes well with the film ) . \\nof course , and as usual , sigourney weaver steals the show . \\nplaying a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional , and more rude and bitter ) , she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable . \\nshe\\'s not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for \" aliens , \" but she\\'s just awesome . \\noverall , it\\'s a thrilling , entertaining film which doesn\\'t really amaze like the first two , but is much more amazing than the third installment . \\nthe style is the best part of the film , which isn\\'t really a bad thing , but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply . \\nbut it\\'s entertaining as hell , and it\\'s definitely fit for the \" alien \" series . \\n',\n",

       " b'set in the late 80\\'s at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis ( who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie , less than zero ) , american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie \" genre \" that ellis helped to create . \\nchristian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman , a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc ? e and his colleagues . \\nit seems that bateman is a serial killer and , unfortunately for his contemporaries , his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip . \\nas he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co-workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies , his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel . \\ni was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school . \\ni read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it . \\nas usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out , but i soon forgot about the novel and didn\\'t end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore . \\ni picked it up and read it , but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers . \\nthe movie has a similar effect , but at least it\\'s less cryptic than ellis\\' novel . \\nfor once , a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on . \\nboth the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations ( down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses ) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout . \\nthe movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman\\'s impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does . \\nas a result , the film is immensely more entertaining . \\nlions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films ( having picked up kevin smith\\'s catholic-rattling dogma ) and here with american psycho there is no difference . \\nscreenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it . \\nsome cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc-17 , mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women , and initial reports said the film was unwatchable . \\nthankfully , it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park : bigger , longer & uncut . \\nside note #1 : co-writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill-fated acquaintance of bateman\\'s who , after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute , proclaims that she\\'s not a lesbian nor has any interest in it . \\nthe ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner ( the writer/director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy ) is a lesbian . \\nit\\'s a subtle in-joke and it\\'s one i found to be pretty humorous . \\ndespite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up-and-comers ( including reese witherspoon ) , most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos . \\nthe real draw here is christian bale and his over-the-top performance as patrick bateman . \\nwhenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters . \\ni always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman , but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being . \\nto say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that he\\'s as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger . \\none sequence in particular , involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news\\' song \" hip to be square \" right before burying an axe in a co-worker\\'s head , features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film . \\nside note #2 : despite the fact that huey lewis\\' \" hip to be square \" and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film , don\\'t expect to see them on the soundtrack release . \\nhuey lewis expressly requested that his song , featured in a rather large set piece in the film ( much akin to the use of \" stuck in the middle with you \" in reservoir dogs ) , not be included on any soundtrack release . \\ni\\'m assuming that collins requested the same . \\non a similar note , whitney houston\\'s cover of \" the greatest love of all \" is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn\\'t the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source . \\napparently , houston wasn\\'t as open about the use of her song as the others were . \\na bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film\\'s release : that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film . \\ndon\\'t look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more . \\nseveral web sites have been dedicated to the subject but i\\'m still undecided . \\nthere is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops , old ladies , and cleaning staff with equal gusto . \\nthe scene seemed very dream-like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying ( as an example , bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car ) . \\ni kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there , but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence , though comic , throws the film off-balance ( which i suppose was the intention ) . \\nother than the few flaws i have mentioned , american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film ( although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in bateman\\'s reality ) . \\ni think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such . \\nit may not change anyone\\'s life , but it will certainly have an effect . \\ni know i will certainly hear \" hip to be square \" in a different context the next time i hear it . \\n[r]

\\nwell , just about as good as baldwin\\'s steven seagal impression ( for those i\\'ve confused the answer is a resounding no ! ) . \\nnow let me clarify , i don\\'t love just any cop movie ; i\\'m not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80\\'s and now slowly ( gulp ) returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker . \\ni\\'m partial to those gritty , earthy cop dramas like serpico , donnie brasco , and the french connection . \\nproblem is these films come along just about as often as george w . bush makes a cogent point so whenever a \" true \" cop movie does hit multiplexes , i come running towards it like an eager puppy ? ? ? and inevitably i leave , head bowed , tripping over my squiggly tail . \\nso what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out $7 . 50 for a movie called one tough cop ( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin-off , no ? ) ? \\ntruth is i\\'m a sucker for those barren streets , that gritty , graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops , like modern day knights , must shield us from their iniquitous clutches . \\nyes it\\'s all very corny and awfully boys clubish , which , i\\'m guessing , is precisely where these feelings come from . \\nas little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe\\'s , enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies , etc . the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies , and heighten them , turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos . \\nas an adult my tastes haven\\'t changed all that drastically ; sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film , but i still delight at the promise a \" guy \" film could potentially bring . \\nnow what if it\\'s the cops who\\'re the corrupt ones ? \\nooh that one really gets me going , these protectors using all that at their service , taking advantage of others for their own gain . \\nthrow a courtroom drama ( yech ! ) \\ninto the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city . \\nhow absorbing is prince of the city , you ask ? \\nso damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub-genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar ) i remained completely and utterly involved . \\nthe film stars treat williams , who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at . \\nsince i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city , i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn\\'t . \\n ( though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves ) . \\nlike mickey rourke and eric roberts ( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory ) williams is a talented leading man who didn\\'t make it to where he should have . \\n ( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell ) . \\nhere , the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino\\'s in serpico ( also directed by lumet ) . \\nwilliams plays danny ciello , a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre-juliani streets of new york . \\nthey work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes . \\nand that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done . \\nthe squad relies entirely on informants ( low level junkies ) to gain access to the big wigs , and in order to obtain the info they seek , they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice . \\ndanny has done this , and though he\\'s a fairly honorable guy , who took the job in order to do good , his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way . \\nhe seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a \" double agent \" . \\nhe does so with one condition : he will not rat on his partners . \\nright away we know that that is exactly what he\\'ll have to do . \\nand watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be . \\nundercover cop films are almost innately exciting , even the kind that pull out all the cliches ( like in too deep ) . \\nhow can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal , ambiguity , and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position ? \\nprince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive , hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet , as well as a handful of intense performances , most notably by treat . \\nlumet\\'s greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back , and lets the camera soak up the action . \\nhis scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension , and he rarely holds for reaction shots , instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking . \\nlumet\\'s worst tendency is one that many film makers ( especially oliver stone ) tend to overuse : he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension . \\nthis isn\\'t as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan , lumet\\'s most recent cop \\\\ lawyer endeavor , a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching . \\nthough of late lumet has made several really awful career choices ( maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something ) , the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria , here he was on , sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot . \\nsome of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic . \\nhollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable . \\nof course cop movies aren\\'t popular anymore ( yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines ) , but just look at the average hollywood action movies , flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn\\'t gay , the lame comic relief character who\\'s never funny , and on and on . \\nfor all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop \\\\ courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills . \\nit focuses completely on its story , and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies . \\nthere\\'s a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he\\'s about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches , but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing . \\nthis is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film ( even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon , not one damn tear ) it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human , excuse me , weak . \\nin the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness , straining to get the words out . \\nhe\\'s lost his voice . \\ndoes that little itty bitty detail matter ? \\nmaybe not to most , but it sure made my night . \\nand in a sprawling epic of corruption , greed , betrayal and violence it\\'s nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things . \\n',\n",

       " b'often similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right venturing into , the call of the oboe ( o toque do oboe ) is a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray . \\nmany elements of the film are solid , and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know , but they simply don\\'t convert into a solid work . \\nalthough a setting is never established , it becomes apparent . \\nthe film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day . \\nthe community is a dull one , where every day is a downhill slide from the last . \\nover time , the people have taken to themselves . \\nthe town cinema is closed , no tourist has passed through in years , and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger . \\nso what happens when a \" tourist \" ( paolo betti ) does arrive one day ? \\nhe sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock . \\nit is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby . \\nwhen he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performance , the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years . \\nit is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers , and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film , thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages . \\nthe woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner ( leticia vota ) who also happens to be engaged to the town\\'s police inspector , a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiance\\'s involvement with this musician . \\nthe rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly astray . \\nit features a character who literally rises from his grave , a woman who has a phone conversation with god , and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character , to an almost humorous drunk . \\ntechnically , this film is a nightmare . \\nthe music score is poorly edited into the film , so it is often choppy , rough , and abrupt . \\nthe lighting is poor at best , which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes , and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words , and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases . \\nthis translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue , but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words . \\nin addition , the pace of the film seems uneven . \\nit opens with a series of long panoramic shots that alone can test one\\'s patience . \\nthe film then moves into a faster pace , that again slows towards the end , as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark . \\nthere was , however , potential for this film . \\nit is a piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music , and the re-unification of people . \\nthese are all topics that could easily fill a movie . \\nperhaps , if there were no freak show , and the technical aspects were to improve , there might just be a thing of beauty at the end . \\nmost importantly , though , the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours aren\\'t such a bore . \\nuntil then , there seems to be little more hope for this piece , than that boy has by simply crying out \" mommy \" while he wanders astray in a park . \\n',\n",

       " b'with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous \" ellen \" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines . \\nthe birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy . \\nthen along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released . \\nit\\'s also noticeable that this \" alternative lifestyle \" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort . \\nwhile it\\'s a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety . \\nbut the way we\\'re using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically . \\nwhile the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy . \\nit doesn\\'t poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it\\'s comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been . \\nthe idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids-afflicted gay man in philadelphia . \\nif you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life . \\nit\\'s a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick . \\nit\\'s true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set . \\nkevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana . \\nafter a three-year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar . \\nthe small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other . \\nwhen cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr . brackett . \\neveryone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , \" and he\\'s gay . \" \\nthe town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop . \\nthe thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf . \\nnaturally the questions pour from howard\\'s fiancee , parents ( debbie reynolds & wilford brimley ) , students , and the high school\\'s principal , tom halliwell ( bob newhart ) , and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious : howard is clean , neat , honest , sincere , a romantic , and perhaps the most incriminating fact , he loves barbara streisand . \\nthe frenzy isn\\'t helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and \" entertainment tonight \" wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning . \\none particular reporter is peter malloy ( tom selleck ) of \" inside entertainment \" , who unlike the collage of other reporters , wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett , including coverage of his wedding . \\nthe intrusion is all but welcome by howard , who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute . \\nit seems that no matter where he turns , a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees . \\nthe dominoes begin to tumble as howard\\'s closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay . \\nit all sounds very devastating , and it would be if it weren\\'t presented with near-perfection by one of this year\\'s most delightful ensemble casts . \\nkline seems only to improve with age , and he is downright perfect here . \\nthe great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine , and they use it wonderfully . \\nevery single actor turns in one of their best performances ever . \\ndillon has never been so likeable , cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role , and brimley , reynolds , and newhart all provide huge laughs when they\\'re up to bat . \\nrudnick\\'s script is heavily laced with wit and humor , and you\\'ll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes . \\nwhile in & out doesn\\'t carry enough to give it four stars , it remains one of the best done films of the year , all-around . \\nthe script is exuberant , the actors are absolutely top- notch , and we\\'re allowed just the perfect blend of heart-tugging so as not to bog down the laughs . \\nit remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety , yet we\\'re still allowed a sappily touching ending . \\ndespite it\\'s subject matter , and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex , this is a movie that everyone could , and should , enjoy . \\nfrank oz , best known as a voice talent for muppets , directs this film quite delightfully , using all the potential rudnick\\'s script has to offer , which turns out to be quite a bit . \\ncheck this one out . \\nyou\\'ll have a gay old time . \\n',\n",

its eventual demotion to a less potent mid-august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio's lack of confidence with the picture . \\nand with good reason . \\nthis is a joyless exercise of a film , held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement , thrills or wit . \\nremarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving , the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year's case study in style over substance , joel schumacher's much-loathed batman & robin . \\n ( indeed , both films even feature appalling , ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes . ) \\numa thurman , who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit-clad , karate-chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg , was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster , imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage . \\nunfortunately , the same can't be said here , where she and cohort ralph fiennes ( our new john steed , taking over for patrick macnee ) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever , fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they're on board a sinking ship . \\nat this rate , usually-splendid actor mr . fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably-neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days . \\nthe duo * look * the part -- and admittedly the avengers is , more than most , heavily dependent upon style -- but they're no fun to watch , and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture's caper-esque plot . \\nwhen not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat , i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs . peel -- no , not kate beckinsale ( although the notion now intrigues me ) , but gwyneth paltrow , who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot-on english accent . \\nif nothing else , it'd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt . \\nthe story , such as it is , involves the ever-bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) , an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate-controlling contraption . \\n ( they also sip a lot of tea . ) \\noverlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists' superiors , it sounds far better than it plays , and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post-production tinkering ; it's clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds . \\nthe avengers was never about gripping drama , and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously , but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac , it's all decidedly uncompelling . \\nmr . connery , who's onscreen barely long enough to register an impression , approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation , simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest . \\nat least it all looks good . \\nthis is a genuinely handsome production , with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt . \\nin particular , the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention , adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain . \\nthere are a handful of striking visual moments in the film , including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water , but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates . \\nby the time the film's climax had arrived , my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain , but with the quickest escape route from the theatre . \\nnot coincidentally , the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie's remarkable trailer , a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself ; the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year . \\nit's everything that the avengers is not -- saucy , clever , engaging , and entertaining . \\na crushing disappointment , the film is one of the worst outings of the year -- too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad , too polished to overlook its deficiencies . \\nthere may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers , but i sure hope not . \\n\",\n",

       " b'robocop is an intelligent science fiction thriller and social satire , one with class and style . \\nthe film , set in old detroit in the year 1991 , stars peter weller as murphy , a lieutenant on the city\\'s police force . \\n1991\\'s detroit suffers from rampant crime and a police department run by a private contractor ( security concepts inc . ) whose employees ( the cops ) are threatening to strike . \\nto make matters worse , a savage group of cop-killers has been terrorizing the city . \\non murphy\\'s first day of duty , after his transfer from another precinct , these cop-killers brutally murder him by shooting off his limbs one by one . \\n ( orion pictures had to edit this extremely graphic scene in order to get an r rating from the m . p . a . a . ) \\nafter the emergency room staff at the hospital cannot save murphy and declare him clinically dead , s . c . i . \\nrecruits his remains for their new \" robocop \" program . \\nusing the remains of murphy\\'s body as a foundation , their scientists build a cyborg , made of both flesh and metal . \\nthe cyborg ( robocop ) is half human ( murphy ) and half robot ; the s . c . i . \\nengineers have erased murphy\\'s memory and replaced it with a computer program ( or so they think ) . \\nwith his lightning quick reflexes , immense strength , and impenetrable armor , s . c . i . \\nenvisions robocop as an indestructible super-cop : the solution to detroit\\'s problems . \\nthe remainder of the plot follows robocop\\'s crime-foiling and vengeance on his murderers . \\nas a science fiction action-thriller , robocop is extremely effective . \\ndutch director paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense , shocking gore , and spectacular special effects . \\nseveral sequences in the film , such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim to stop a rapist , are destined to become cult-classics . \\nbecause robocop is so visually and emotionally rousing , it demands to be seen on a large screen with an audience--in other words , in a movie theater . \\nalthough the special effects and action are exciting , they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre . \\nrather , robocop stands out for its accurate and biting satire of american society . \\nthe movie makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative , terrorism , board games , and television news broadcasts with air-headed anchors . \\nthese news broadcasts , which are exceptionally clever , recur periodically throughout the movie and help to provide comic relief from the intense action and gore . \\nthe satire in robocop , however , is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense and blood . \\n1990\\'s america , as portrayed in the film , may seem far fetched but is in actuality ( i think ) only a slight exaggeration of the current state of american society . \\nthe humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible and absurd . \\nverhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an entertaining and enlightening piece of science fiction/social commentary . \\nunfortunately , robocop possesses several flaws which prevent it from qualifying as a classic within the genre . \\nthe movie lacks the lasting impact of such films as the road warrior , the terminator , and aliens . \\nrobocop\\'s main problem , aside from its dumb title , is that it does not sufficiently develop murphy\\'s character . \\nwe never learn the degree to which murphy ( as robocop ) is human and the degree to which he is a robot . \\ndoes murphy have any human spirit or free will left , or is he merely a computer following a program ? \\nthe script halfheartedly raises these issues but then abandons them in its climactic flurry of gory action . \\nmoreover , it almost completely ignores the question ( and tragedy ) of denying a man his right to die in favor of turning him into a machine . \\nrobocop also contains several bothersome loose-ends . \\nas you watch robocop , you experience deja vu ; you feel as if you have seen the film before . \\nin many respects , robocop is reminiscent of several other films , including the terminator , return of the jedi , and even death wish . \\nhowever , to its credit , robocop easily has enough originality and unique personality to avoid becoming a cheap rip-off . \\n',\n",

these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots . \\nexcept for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table . \\nthe reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it . \\nwe\\'re given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them . \\nmatt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker . \\ned norton\\'s worm is truly a worm , always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they\\'re worth . \\njohn turturro , who amazes me with his acting range , tones it down in this film by playing joey knish , a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments . \\nhe\\'s both a friend and mentor to mike , and turturro\\'s low-key performance is totally convincing , just as john malkovich\\'s heavily-accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself . \\nmartin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike\\'s law professors , abe petrovsky . \\nwhile landau slips well into the role , his character , spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one\\'s self , facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending . \\nperhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent , however , is gretchen mol who just didn\\'t seem to have much presence on screen . \\nshe\\'s a genuine peach to look at , kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldn\\'t be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world ) , but her delivered lines seemed very flat , and i found myself looking for matt damon\\'s reactions instead . \\na good thing about rounders is that it doesn\\'t get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can\\'t find time for humor . \\nthe film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going , such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next , in widely different locales . \\none game in a cigar club had me in stitches . \\n \" i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper , \" says one of the players , clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other . \\ni was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys . \\nwith all the poker being played , rounders had the potential to be very confusing . \\nyou might think you know a lot about poker , but think again . \\nluckily , we\\'re given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what\\'s going on . \\nthe narrations are more informative than intrusive , and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do . \\nit\\'s nice that as the characters develop , so does our comprehension of their world . \\nas a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker , rounders delivers in spades . \\nwait ! \\nas a film about the culture of cards , rounders is an ace . \\nhang on ! \\npacked with great acting and great characters , rounders is a full house . \\nokay , i guess that\\'s enough . \\noh , by the way , if you ever want to get into a game with ol\\' gabe kaplan , be sure to bring a note from epstein\\'s mother . \\n',\n",

       " b'talk about beating a dead horse ! \\nwhen home alone was released in 1990 , it was a breath of fresh air , and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely-funny family film . \\nthe unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel , so , two years later , we were subjected to home alone 2 , which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited . \\nfor john hughes , two home alone movies weren\\'t enough ? he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with , including a pathetic box office bomb called baby\\'s day out , last year\\'s live-action 101 dalmatians , and this year\\'s flubber . \\nnow , inexplicably , hughes has exhumed not only these worn-out plot elements , but the \" home alone \" name as well . \\nthe result ? 1997\\'s worst sequel ( edging out speed 2 and batman and robin ) , home alone 3 . \\nby changing the characters , hughes ( who wrote and co-produced the film ) , along with his co-conspirator , director raja gosnell , has attempted to inject new life into a series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest . \\nthe new kid , alex pruitt , is played by alex d . linz ( one fine day ) , and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness . \\nhe\\'s not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was . \\nthe villains , pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern , are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber . \\nin home alone 3 , there are four of them ( olek krupa , david thornton , lenny von dohlen , and rya kihlstedt ) , but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls . \\nthis time , the kid isn\\'t left home alone because his parents have gone on a trip . \\ninstead , he has developed a bad case of chicken pox , so he can\\'t go to school . \\nhis dad ( kevin kilner ) is away on business and his mom ( haviland morris ) has to run errands , so , for the most part , he\\'s all by himself during the day . \\nthrough a series of coincidences too irritating to relate , a top secret u . s . air force integrated circuit comes into his possession . \\nit\\'s wanted by a gang of four international crooks who intend to break into alex\\'s home to retrieve it . \\nthe eight- year old , who is wise beyond his years , booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldberg-type devices designed to humiliate and incapacitate the villains . \\nthe movie\\'s climax takes place during a raging snowstorm ? only none of the falling flakes looks remotely believable . \\npreviously , the most counterfeit-looking snow effects i can remember were in star trek iii . \\nthese are far worse . \\nin fact , the production values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this near-blizzard when a shining sun can be seen . \\nif it\\'s a wonderful life could generate real- looking snow back in the 1940s , why can\\'t home alone 3 , which has a significantly larger budget and \\'90s technology at its disposal ? \\nthere has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of live-action cartoon violence for young children . \\nhome alone 3 will add fuel to the fire . \\nit\\'s one thing to see wyle e . coyote flattened by a 10 ton acme weight , but quite another to watch a running lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen . \\nadults and even older children will recognize that this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous , but what about five and six-year olds ? \\nthe level of violence in home alone 3 is extreme ? many of alex\\'s schemes are nasty enough to kill . \\nbut , because this is a \" family film , \" no one dies , despite being electrocuted , falling thirty feet , and getting smacked on the head by a barbell . \\nnot only is home alone 3 unnecessary , but it\\'s offensive . \\nit\\'s an exercise in tediousness , and there isn\\'t a genuine laugh to be found from the beginning to the end ( unless , by some strange quirk of fate , you have missed every 1990s movie associated with john hughes , and thus haven\\'t seen this stuff before ) . \\ni can\\'t imagine anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure . \\nmaybe that\\'s why the only ones laughing at the screening i attended were still in their thumb-sucking years . \\n',\n",
       " b'i\\'m not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream , but i\\'m guessing after just because it seems he may not have had time to write a second draft . \\nseriously , this idea--a psycho bumping off people in the style of urban legends--is a great one and i wish it could have been pulled off . \\nthe first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue . \\nan example : \" that [car crash] must\\'ve been awful . . . for \\neveryone involved . \" \\nyou can tell that the writer intended that something a little more airy was supposed to have been said , just no one figured out what . \\ni know in slasher movies there isn\\'t supposed to be a lot of great characterization and i myself don\\'t mind cardboard cutouts , but please don\\'t let the cutouts be so damn bland . \\none reason movies like scream , star wars and diva have become so treasured is because they feature charismatic actors playing interesting characters . \\naside from jared leto and joshua jackson ( who aren\\'t on the screen long enough ) no one in urban legend makes the grade . \\nalicia witt shows none of the acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill , rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive ( not to mention as dumb as a post through 3/4 of the film ) and robert englund just cruises on auto pilot . \\ngood thing brad dourif is here , but wait . . . he\\'s only in the movie for five minutes _and_ he\\'s just redoing his good-natured stuttering character from one flew over the cuckoo\\'s nest . \\nwhich brings me to another aspect of urban legend : it\\'s unoriginality . \\nthe film most blatantly ripped off is scream ( another reason that makes me think silvio horta wrote this after craven\\'s and williamson\\'s great success ) . \\nurban legend tries to deconstruct modern-day folklore much the same way scream deconstructed slasher films , but it doesn\\'t quite succeed . \\nit\\'s best stab at self-reflexivity is poking fun at \" that girl in the noxzeema ad \" ( ie , rebecca gayheart ) we also have another killer-taunting-his-victim-on-the-phone routine in urban legend and quick , what movie is this exchange of dialogue from : \\nfemale protagonist : why ? \\nvillain : why ? \\nwhy ? ! ? \\ncongratulations to those of you who answered scream and/or urban legend . \\nlike i said , this movie could\\'ve been great . \\nif only silvio had worked or been allowed to work a little longer on the script . \\nstill , at least urban legend had some pretty cool death scenes and a somewhat realized whodunit angle which makes this slasher is waaaayyyyyy better than i know what you did last summer . \\n',\n",
       " b'synopsis : it\\'s 1977 in a small italian american neighborhood in new york . \\ndisco music is popular , and the sexual revolution is on , but the people of new york are not happy . \\nin fact , they\\'re terrified . \\nas in spike lee\\'s do the right thing a heat wave has the city in its grip , and peoples\\' tempers are flaring . \\nthe cool of night offers no respite : the neighborhood is being terrorized by a nocturnal psychotic killer who calls himself the son of sam . \\nno one knows who the son of sam is , and no one is safe . \\nall around new york people are different . \\naside from cultural groupings and ethnic neighborhoods there are differences between individuals . \\nin the italian american section of town a philandering husband named vinny ( john leguizamo ) tries to hide his trysts and sexual behavior from his long suffering newlywed wife dionna ( mira sorvino ) . \\nvinny\\'s friend ritchie ( adrien brody ) hates disco , works at a gay strip club and doesn\\'t want any of the neighborhood folks to know . \\nritchie\\'s girl ruby ( jennifer esposito ) is trying to escape a reputation as a slut . \\neveryone\\'s different , but nobody in the film wants to be framed as \" alien \" to the community . \\nunfortunately , the killings help create a climate of suspicion pits neighbor against neighbor . \\nopinion : director spike lee\\'s summer of sam is not about a psycho killer . \\nnor is it about cops trying to apprehend him . \\nit\\'s about differences and how , given the right conditions , even close neighbors can fan the hostile flames of irrational suspicion . \\none thing i found interesting in summer of sam was the use of sex . \\nin other movies sex is glamorized . \\nfor example , james bond gets a sexual reward for winning . \\nor boring made-for-video \" suspense \" movies are spiked with gratuitous lingerie scenes just to keep the audience awake . \\nand every movie or soap opera character in these flicks seems to have expert sexual prowess . \\nnot so with summer of sam . \\nin a very gutsy move director spike lee shows sex without fantasy . \\nsex is there , but it isn\\'t gratuitous or titillating . \\nin fact , some of the main characters are downright lousy in bed . \\nsex is in the film because ( sexual ) deviance is part of the film\\'s major theme of \" difference \" breeding hostility . \\nin my opinion this kind of movie sex is cutting edge for 1999 , as rare and thought-provoking in american cinema as showing a spanking . \\n',\n",
       " b\"at the outset of swordfish , john travolta's gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today . \\nbasically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers . \\nhow ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture . \\nswordfish is loud , violent and amoral . \\nit has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life . \\nand how does travolta's gabriel plan to do this ? \\nby robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out-terrorize terrorists . \\nswordfish is a very cynical movie . \\nit relies on an audience's perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non-human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration . \\nthe movie's plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you'd actually see how ridiculous it all is . \\nthis is a live-action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly that it's over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions . \\nthe storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman ) , recruited by gabriel to crack the government's computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti-terrorist campaign . \\ntalk about whacked-out patriotism . \\nmy objections to swordfish are many . \\nthe body count is high , but that is expected in a movie of this sort . \\nit's becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers , police officers and government agents blown to bits . \\nanother example is the family dynamics between stanley , his 10-year-old daughter and his ex-wife . \\nstanley , though having served time in prison for hacking , is shown as a loving and caring father , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl . \\naudience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband's adult films . \\nthus when she is found murdered late in the movie , neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve . \\nin fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed . \\nthen there is the sequence involving one of gabriel's henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley's daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel . \\nchildren as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich ? in recent films . \\nthere is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on-screen victims as well . \\nyea , it's only make believe , but that doesn't mean you have to tolerate it . \\ntravolta is cool , deadly charming and flamboyant as the near-crazy gabriel . \\nhis character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face/off . \\njackman looks dour through most of the proceedings . \\nhis only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database . \\nhis sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate . \\nhalle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel's assistant , while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel . \\nswordfish plays like a comic book with a larger-than-life character in gabriel . \\nviewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain . \\nand maybe that is the movie's underlying flaw : there is no real hero to speak of , only those doing their upmost to survive . \\nand that is not enough . \\nthis is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water . \\n\",\n",
       " b'robin williams has the rarest of gifts : the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style . \\noverwhelmingly , his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best ( with the notable exception of flubber ) . \\nso when i , the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams , tell you that not even williams can save his latest project , you know it\\'s in trouble . \\njakob the liar is a confused , muddled little movie ; a generically \" uplifting \" film with a fundamental contradiction : the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesn\\'t realize it . \\nwilliams plays jakob haim , a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii . \\none night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a high-ranking german officer for his punishment . \\njakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast . \\nthe announcement ( in english , but punctuated by a triumphant \" heil hitler ! \" ) is that russian troops are only miles away from jakob\\'s ghetto . \\nliberation ! he thinks . \\nthe next day , jakob tells the news to his closest friend , a volatile prize fighter named misha ( liev schreiber ) , who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along . \\nsoon , it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home -- a crime punishable by death . \\nthis is absurdly false , but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this , the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate . \\nthe danger , of course , is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto , and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger . \\nin a curiously irrelevant subplot , jakob finds a 11-year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home . \\napparently he is afraid that she will be discovered , and goes to great length to make sure of that -- just why the idea frightens him is never made clear . \\nhe and the girl build an uninvolving , generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning . \\nthe moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine . \\nbut jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false . \\nsuch hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations aren\\'t met , the results are far worse than if there was no hope . \\nthat\\'s the film\\'s biggest detriment : it is based on a false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false . \\nit\\'s never moving because it doesn\\'t give us anything to be moved by . \\njakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing . \\nrobin williams doesn\\'t inject the film with life , as a matter of fact , he seems a little out of it , as if crippled by his fake accent . \\nhe is stragely unenthusiastic ; his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless , hopeless . \\nnot since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent ; this isn\\'t the robin williams we know and love . \\nin good will hunting he became a serious actor and won an oscar for it . \\nhere , he is more of a wannabe serious actor ; an impostor . \\njakob the liar will be compared with last year\\'s life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a \" holocaust comedy \" . \\nit\\'s not a comedy . \\nit tries , sometimes , but it rarely works . \\nis it a melodrama ? \\na war movie ? \\na character study ? \\nno , no , and no . \\njakob the liar is the kind of movie that can\\'t be placed into a category ; not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts . \\n',\n",

       " b' \" mercury rising \" has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary . \\nthat\\'s right . \\nthe major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better . \\nthis central device is the fact that a nine-year-old boy is autistic . \\nhis name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it . \\nsimon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him . \\nthe fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of \" mercury rising . \" \\ni suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon\\'s character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost . \\nmiko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he\\'s touched , and has a hard time looking at other people . \\nit\\'s a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn\\'t playing like he\\'s autistic . \\nunlike dustin hoffman\\'s performance in \" rain man \" or leonardo dicaprio\\'s in \" what\\'s eating gilbert grape , \" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting . \\nhowever , unlike \" rain man \" which used its character\\'s autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , \" mercury rising \" could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid . \\nhell , he doesn\\'t even have to be shy . \\nin fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis\\' arm . \\nwillis\\' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything . \\nhe becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon\\'s house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide . \\nof course , we know that isn\\'t the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square-jawed government hitman with a mean-looking crew-cut knock off the parents . \\nsimon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked . \\njeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon . \\nthis is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon\\'s parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes . \\nlate in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop . \\nof all the hard-to-believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst . \\ni can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey\\'s character is far too accommodating . \\nnot only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o\\'clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent . \\nthe grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point . \\nthe movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here \" mercury rising \" doesn\\'t rise to the challenge . \\nthe movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including \" sea of love \" ( 1989 ) and \" malice \" ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion . \\nthere is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and 3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were . \\nthe grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it\\'s more suspenseful that way . \\ntaken as a whole , \" mercury rising \" is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor . \\nusually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious . \\nthis is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts . \\nmaybe the book was better , but the way it\\'s handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore . \\n',\n",
       " b'more than forty years ago , the \" sword and sandals \" genre of historical epic ruled the box office . \\nduring the 1950\\'s hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope . \\n \" ben-hur . \" \\n \" cleopatra . \" \\n \" the robe . \" \\n \" sparticus . \" \\n \" the fall of the roman empire . \" \\n \" quo vadis . \" \\nsometimes brilliant , sometimes campy , the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood . \\nsince then , epics have appeared infrequently ( \" the last emperor , \" \" braveheart \" ) and some of the best have been small-screen affairs produced in the 1970\\'s ( \" roots , \" \" shogun \" ) . \\nyet , the phrase \" we who are about to die salute you \" has been absent until now . \\n \" gladiator \" begins in germania in a . d . 180 . \\nroman general maximus ( russell crowe ) has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting . \\nhowever , the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) will prove a poor successor , so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again . \\nwhen commodus hears the plan , he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered . \\nmaximus escapes from the executioners , but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son . \\na caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa . \\n ( why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus\\' place is never explained . ) \\nan african named juba ( djimon hounsou ) treats maximus\\' wounds . \\nproximo ( oliver reed ) , a gladiator who won his freedom , purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena . \\nof course , maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier , and his fame spreads . \\nwhen commodus reopens the coliseum , proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete . \\nour hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus\\' sister lucilla ( connie nielsen ) . \\nthe similarities to \" braveheart \" are obvious : an evil king , a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family , the aid of a lovestruck princess . \\nalso , like mel gibson\\'s epic , \" gladiator \" has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero\\'s anger . \\nit\\'s a simple tale of good versus evil . \\nmaximus has all the manly virtues : nobility of purpose , courage in battle , loyalty to king and country , physical stamina , and devotion to family . \\ncommodus is his opposite in every way : a sniveling , selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience . \\nthe opening night crowd in my theater was about 70% male , and that seems appropriate . \\n \" gladiator \" is a guy movie ( would the opposite of a \" chick flick \" be a \" dick flick \" ? ) . \\nthere\\'s much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences . \\n ( those easily offended by gore should stay away . ) \\nlucilla is the only female character , and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife . \\njoaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance . \\nin the scene where commodus kills his father , phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father\\'s love or pride . \\nthroughout the picture , phoenix manages to give depth to a character who\\'s scripted as a caricature of evil . \\ni\\'ve been a russell crowe fan since \" romper stomper . \" \\nthis role doesn\\'t offer him the complexities of his parts in \" l . \\na . confidential \" and \" the insider \" -- essentially his job is to grunt heroically -- but his voice , which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp , is perfect for the genre . \\nthe late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role . \\ni hope it will be rewarded with an oscar . \\nmy only major quibble with \" gladiator \" is its stylized look . \\nseveral scenes are tinted . \\nwe\\'ve seen a lot of the tinted look lately , particularly in \" payback \" and \" the matrix . \" \\ni don\\'t get the appeal of the style , which makes feature films look like tv ads . \\nin \" payback \" it was merely annoying , but in \" gladiator \" it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison d\\'etre of the roman epic . \\n ( perhaps it\\'s meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computer-generated shots . ) \\nalso , the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously . \\n ( it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books , leaving a half-blurred trail of images of himself behind . ) \\nwith a more realistic look , \" gladiator \" could be even more satisfying than \" braveheart \" because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion . \\nbottom line : a rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished by stylistic choices . \\n',\n",
       " b'senseless is a prime example of what can happen when you try to push a one-joke concept a bit too far . \\ndirector penelope spheeris is no stranger to this , having subjected audiences before to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies . \\nmarlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon , a college senior vying for a lucrative job at a prominent brokerage . \\nhowever , he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition , scott thorpe ( david spade , in the smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep ) : an athletic record , sponsorship by a fraternity , and , most of all , a wealthy family to back him up . \\nin fact , darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet . \\nbut there may be a light at the end of that tunnel . \\nhe signs up as a human guinea pig in a neurological experiment run by the university\\'s dr . wheedon ( brad dourif ) . \\nas a result , his senses are magnified tenfold . \\nusing his newfound abilities , he sets himself in complete pursuit of the job ( unaware that there may be some disadvantageous side-effects to having super senses ) . \\nnaturally , marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle , giving jim carrey-ish amounts of physical humor . \\nthe problem is , aside from a few genuinely inspired bits , there\\'s not much that\\'s funny here . \\nthe film has it\\'s one central gag , and pads out the rest of its length with rather obvious lowbrow humor . \\nthere obviously wasn\\'t much thought put into the plot . \\nthe entire job selection process is completely ridiculous . \\ni mean , why the emphasis on extra-curricular activities if the entire job is going to come down to a single-elimination quiz anyhow ? \\nand is this the only job being offered to economics majors this semester ? \\nto give it credit , senseless does try to create a secondary joke with darryl\\'s roommate , tim laflour ( matthew lillard ) . \\napparently , he is supposed to be faddish , but the film never does anything with him , leaving him in a piercing phase throughout the movie . \\nhis \" intervention \" scenes with darryl , however , do provide a rare , and welcome , laugh . \\nand then there\\'s the love interest which is always pathetically tacked onto comedies like this one . \\nin this case , the object of darryl\\'s amor is janice ( tamara taylor ) , a fellow student who won\\'t have anything to do with darryl until he gains his super-senses . \\nneedless to say , the romance is completely extraneous , and adds little to the film . \\nthis is a film that desperately needed something else . \\nbe that a good plot , more jokes ( or simply funnier ones ) , or a strong character or two , anything would have helped senseless get off the ground . \\nas it is , all the manic exuberant mugging in the world can\\'t help marlon wayans get this one off the ground . \\n',\n",
       " b'in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black . \\nsir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner . \\nhis oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake . \\nthe daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes . \\nhopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts . \\nwhichever one you like , dear , he says . \\nand the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries . \\ni liked that scene for two reasons . \\nfirst , the cakes looked really cool . \\nsecond , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act . \\nmeet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot . \\nit\\'s easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it\\'s even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) . \\nthe difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess . \\ni know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy . \\ncase in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie . \\nhowever , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani . \\n ( it\\'s not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . ) \\nit shouldn\\'t take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr . pitt . \\nand indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished . \\nwell , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous . \\nso , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately . \\nanyway , the deceased lawyer\\'s body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role . \\nthe idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world . \\nif this weren\\'t hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who\\'s wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn\\'t know how to act in our society . \\nit also doesn\\'t help that the character of death is written so inconsistently . \\nhe claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) . \\nhe speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois . \\nhe knows everything about some characters , nothing about others . \\nand as played by brad pitt , he\\'s not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he\\'s just there . \\nit\\'s as if someone told pitt , \" never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty . \" \\nit\\'s as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie . \\ni\\'ve used the phrase \" angel of death \" in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt\\'s performance with this year\\'s best angel performance , nicolas cage\\'s in city of angels . \\nwhere pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows . \\nwhere cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant . \\ncage struck instant chemical sparks with co-star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani\\'s character is so shallow that she can\\'t see beyond pitt\\'s good looks . \\nthe movie\\'s other top name is a much better actor , but that doesn\\'t save meet joe black . \\nsir anthony hopkins isn\\'t given much better material to work with , unfortunately . \\nhe plays one of these good-hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood . \\n ( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins\\'s character more realistically evil . ) \\nhopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world . \\nof course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder . \\nbut i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire . \\nhopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation . \\nfans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i\\'m sure . \\ni stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i\\'m asking myself why . \\nmovies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i\\'m going to do now . \\ngo spend time with your family , go volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap . \\ndon\\'t go see meet joe black , because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death .

       " b'these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes . \\nbut , only a few years ago , before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice , sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers . \\nsequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south . \\nthe way to regain popularity and prestige , they thought , was the use the same formulas , characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place . \\none of such celebrity was eddie murphy , black comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade . \\nin order to return to the spotlight , he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film , beverly hills cop , 1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987 . \\nseven years later , for the third instalment , he used the directorial service of john landis , another fading star , with whom he successfully collaborated twice - in trading places and coming to america . \\nthis time , however , third time wasn\\'t the charm and beverly hills iii was failure . \\neddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback . \\neddie murphy here plays axel foley , fast-talking streetwise detroit policeman , who raids illegal chop shop . \\nthe routine police action ends in tragedy , when the criminals kill foley\\'s boss . \\ndetermined to bring the killers to justice , foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald ( timothy carhart ) . \\nwhen it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles , foley goes back to los angeles . \\nthere , with the help of his old friend , local policeman rosewood ( judge rheinhold ) , foley would clash with money counterfeit ring . \\nten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different . \\nin this decade , the contrast between blue collar detroit and yuppie beverly hills , which provided a lot of gags in 1984 film , simply doesn\\'t work . \\nscreenwriter steven e . de souza provides another conflict , this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys and business-like professionalism of the bad guys . \\nsince foley belongs to the former , his character had to watch his language , and the tone of the film in general is more infantile . \\nunfortunately , this film still belongs to action movie genre , and there is too much violence for little children . \\nnice example is the humorous scene in the beginning , which turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath . \\nunlike donner with the lethal weapon series , landis simply can\\'t balance the comedy with \" regular \" action , and the result is a film that fails in both aspects . \\naction scenes are sometimes interesting , but not too spectacular ( at the end , scenery of wonderland is more fascinating than the action itself ) ; humour , on the other hand , falls flat . \\nto make even worse , some minor characters from 1984 film gets unnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure ( especially art expert turned into arms dealer , played by bronson pinchot ) . \\nin the end , although the film provided some entertainment , viewers , at least critical ones , would probably be happy to know that there aren\\'t any plans for beverly hills iv . \\n',\n",
       " b\"my giant begins with a monologue that's more funny than not and a distinctive `princess bride , ' medieval fairy-tale-in-the- ? 90s feel . \\ni was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was , with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy ( billy crystal ) is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream . \\nand when sammy meets max , his giant , mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan , there is magic in the air ; albeit it a bit goofy , i loved every minute of it . \\nthe film , of course , plays on the size difference between the two , and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects . \\ni particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max-sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons . \\ni also liked jere burns' ( from tv's `something so right' ) performance as the director of the film in romania . \\nat this point , the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand , particularly during his fast-paced first scene . \\nit is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate , as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech . \\nhowever , about the time muresan becomes coherent , the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive . \\noff the high board . \\nsuddenly , we are expected to believe sammy is a do-whatever-it-takes slime ball . \\nup until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure , but he didn't come off as a desperate jerk . \\nif he had , the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical . \\nbut now , in new york , we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son , and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs . midgets wrestling match , which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film . \\nindeed , many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces . \\nthis includes the scenes featuring steven seagal , when sammy gets max a role in a big , hollywood movie filming in las vegas . \\nwhile i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself , the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation , rather than because the film demanded it . \\nand the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare . \\nat this point i found myself thinking , `we're supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film ? ' \\nthen i realized he was , and i was watching it . \\nin the final third , the film undergoes another transformation , this time to unbridled sentimentality . \\nnote : major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph . \\nmax went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love , lillianna , who hasn't seen him since he was a normal-sized kid . \\nher refusal to see max ( unbeknownst to him ) leads us to an awkward `ends justify the means' scene as sammy's wife serena , played nicely by kathleen quinlan , poses as lillianna . \\ni found this scene offensive . \\nnot only did it rely on deception to induce warm , fuzzy feelings from the audience , it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle , which i thought was quite undeserved . \\ni think max could have handled the truth , gratuitous illness and all . \\nlate in the film we learn max , and in fact all giants , have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably . \\nthis could be an enlightening revelation , but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammy's transformation into a caring , sensitive guy -- and hey , a great dad and husband , too ! \\n`my giant' suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions . \\na stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on max's struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammy's struggles to get money and become a better person . \\nin this scenario , max's illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator . \\nsentiment and emotion would have followed naturally . \\ninstead , we're apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end , but we're not allowed to focus on max . \\ncrystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances , but in the end , `my giant' left me feeling like i'd been fed gruel from a giant spoon . \\n\",\n",
       " b'when i first heard that disney\\'s next animated feature was going to be tarzan , i was almost horrified . \\ni was worried that disney was going to make another hercules ( sorry , jerk-ules ) . \\nthat effort was too overloaded with comedy ( and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero ) , and , after viewing it to this day , i find it a disgrace for disney animation . \\nwhen i saw the trailers , i was thinking \" hmm . . . \\nthis isn\\'t bad at all . \\nthis just might have potential . \" \\nwhen i bought the soundtrack , i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features . \\ni have never really heard of phil collins , nor have i heard of mark mancina , so i was wondering , how would these two make this disney flick spin ? \\ni was pleasantly surprised : the music is top-notch . \\nphil collins\\' songs are terrific , percussion-heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs . \\nthe score from mark mancina was also neat ; it reminded me a bit of the lion king , but it was more original . \\nso , the soundtrack wasn\\'t bad at all , considering it was by two people i am not familiar with . \\nthis film could be good . . . \\nbut will it be ? \\nwhen i finally went to see it ( on opening day , as i tend to do with most disney animated features ) , my question was answered , in a complete turnabout of expectations for me : disney\\'s tarzan is surprisingly decent . \\nthe story starts out with tarzan\\'s parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace . \\nhowever , one day , a vicious leopard , sabor , attacks and kills tarzan\\'s parents , leaving him ( at this time , a baby ) alone-until kala of the apes rescues him . \\nkala wants to raise the child as her own ( she lost hers previously to sabor ) , but her mate , kerchak is not too sure . \\n \" it\\'s not our kind , \" he says . \\nhe agrees , though , to let her take care of little tarzan , but \" that doesn\\'t make him my son . \" \\ntarzan grows up , vowing to be \" the best ape ever \" , but no matter how hard he tries or what he does ( at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend , terk ) , he just can\\'t convince kerchak that he is one of the apes , even when he defeats sabor in a battle . \\none day , a new animal shows up : humans . \\nthis is where jane comes into the picture . \\nshe is on an expedition with her father ( professor porter ) , and a despicable hunter ( clayton ) searching for gorillas . \\ntarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons , and soon they get to know each other . \\neven though tarzan falls in love with jane , this causes things to go wrong . \\nclayton tricks tarzan into taking him , jane , and porter to see the apes , who are convinced that he has betrayed them . \\nworse , clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money . \\nwill tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes ? \\ni\\'m not gonna tell you , sorry . \\nyou\\'re gonna have to see for yourself . \\nand see it you should ; the animation is , as always , top notch , particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees ( read that , skateboarding ) . \\nthe deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in . \\nin fact , it seems similar to the computer imagery/cel animation combination in rival disney animted films , such as fox\\'s anastasia and dreamworks\\' prince of egypt . \\ncould it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals ? \\nthe casting is fairly good . \\ntony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan ( and to my relief , the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules . \\nnicely done ) , and glenn close is wonderful as kala ( she has a beautiful singing voice , too , by the way ) . \\nlance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson\\'s beast voice , which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping . \\nminnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane . \\ni thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film ( when i first saw the trailers ) , but when i saw the film , i didn\\'t have a problem with her . \\ni take back my insult on driver . \\nit\\'s nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature ( he was fflewdurr flamm in disney\\'s most underrated classic , the black cauldron ) ; he is funny and delightful as professor porter . \\non the villiany side of the voices , brian blessed ( the guy who did boss nass in star wars : episode i-the phantom menace ) brings a pompous , and later on vicious , voice to the sinister clayton . \\nhe might not be the strongest character in the film ( he\\'s just a plain bad guy , nothing else ) , but blessed\\'s vocal work contributes greatly . \\nbut if there is any voice that i think steals the whole show , it should be rosie o\\'donnell , who is hilariously funny as terk . \\nshe also has a fiesty attitude ( \" i\\'m gonna kill ya ! \" \\nshe says , more than once ) . \\ni almost sung along with her during one of the film\\'s best moments , where the apes make a mess of the human\\'s camp , via song , er , scatting \" shoo-be-doo , da-be-dah \" . \\ni can see why she wanted to have a rock song for the film , she\\'s a good singer . \\nnot that she was the only funny character in the film , though . \\nwayne knight ( who played stan in space jam ) gives a whimsically funny style to tantor , an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into \" un-sanitary \" water . \\n ( thankfully , there is no real sound of flatuence-that would have killed the picture ) . \\nthe songs , as i said before , are decent , mostly sung by collins . \\nthis sets a new standard for disney animated films because for the first time , the characters do not sing . \\ni tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more than some other guys would , but i found this to be a nice change of pace . \\nthe story does have elements of comedy in it , but they also load it with strong dramatic touches , which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules . \\nif there is anything disappointing about tarzan , it might be the omission of the \\'n sync version of \" trashing the camp \" from the film . \\ni heard it on the soundtrack , and wondered where it was going to be . \\ni was upset that it wasn\\'t , because i had thought of taking a few friends of mine who like \\'n sync to see tarzan . \\noh , well . . . \\noverall , i was enthralled with tarzan . \\ni wouldn\\'t hold it high the way i do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame ( my all-time favorite disney classics ) , but this film deserves a high place among disney\\'s greatest achievements . \\ni give a nod to disney for following up their spectacular * * * * * masterpiece , mulan , with this great animated adaption of egar rice burrough\\'s tarzan . \\n',\n",
       " b'cinematically speaking , gordon parks\\' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film . \\na bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman\\'s \" black private dick that\\'s a sex machine to all the chicks \" to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking . \\nyet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned , \" blaxploitation , \" died with that decade--the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness . \\nthe reason for this is the same one that explains the film\\'s connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft . \\nwhile the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass . \\nthis fact also explains why john singleton\\'s y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is . \\nmuch like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_\\'s plot doesn\\'t score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers . \\ncontrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel/spinoff . \\nthe star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972\\'s _shaft\\'s_big_score ! _ and 1973\\'s _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city . \\nhowever , the focus of the film lies on his same-named nephew ( samuel l . jackson ) , who , as the film begins , is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors . \\nwhen a privileged young man named walter wade jr . ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal , racially-motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail , a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p . i . \\nbut that\\'s easier said than done , for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri ( toni collette ) , the only eyewitness to his crime . \\npeoples--or , rather , wright is also the big obstacle in jackson\\'s way toward commanding this film . \\npeoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time , and wright is insanely funny during these stages . \\nhowever , he isn\\'t so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish , and peoples\\' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable ( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo , who bowed out before filming ) . \\nit\\'s no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating , charismatic self here ) , but that\\'s exactly what wright does--and makes it seem effortless . \\nthen again , with such a talented ensemble surrounding him , it is not too surprising that jackson\\'s impressive star turn doesn\\'t quite tower over the rest ; he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co-stars . \\nbale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ , so it only follows that his performance as a similar , less exaggerated character would be spot-on . \\ncollette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened , conflicted diane . \\nbusta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft\\'s sidekick rasaan . \\nregistering not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno . \\n ( jackson also has little to \" do \" in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside , his shaft doesn\\'t even have one sex scene . ) \\nthat singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he\\'s not really an action director . \\nthis is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases . \\nthey move well ( as does the film as a whole ) and are reasonably exciting ; it\\'s just that there\\'s nothing terribly inventive about them . \\nthese set pieces are functional in the way the script is : they work well enough , but they\\'re unsurprising and conventional . \\nbut if there\\'s anything that a _shaft_ movie does well , it\\'s make the familiar look cool--and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive . \\nfrom the slick title sequence--scored , of course , to isaac hayes\\' ever-infectious oscar-winning theme song , which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film--on , the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado . \\neven a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced , it feels necessary . \\nstyle doesn\\'t exactly make for a great film , but when it comes to _shaft_ , that\\'s of little consequence . \\nwhat matters above all else is having a good time , and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha--shut your mouth . \\n',\n",
       " b'fritz lang\\'s first american film since leaving nazi germany , is an eye-opener about a lynch mob in a small town . \\njoe wilson ( spencer tracy ) is a regular joe , a hard-working stiff , a decent guy , who is living with his two brothers , tom ( walcott ) and charlie ( albertson ) , in chicago . \\nhe is engaged to katherine grant ( sylvia sidney ) , but can\\'t save up enough money to marry her . \\nshe takes the train west for a better paying job as a teacher . \\nbefore she departs , she gives him the wedding ring her father gave to her mother , sews up his ripped trench coat , corrects him when he mistakingly says the wrong word for memento , and kisses him goodbye . \\na year goes by and joe buys a car and tells katherine that he will meet her to get married in capitol city , that he has quit his job and hopes to open a gas station . \\ndriving through the rural backroads and camping out at night while going to met her , he arrives at a near-by town called strand . \\nbut the deputy sheriff \" buggs \" meyers ( walter brennan ) comes upon him waving a shotgun and arrests him . \\nhe accuses him of the kidnapping of a little girl . \\nthe sheriff ( ellis ) finds salted peanuts on him just like the kidnapper had in his pocket , he also has a five dollar bill on him that matches one of the numbers of the ransom money , and he fits the general description of the suspect . \\nlocked in jail , he waits for the district attorney to look at his claim of innocence . \\nin the local bar , the town citizens go into a rage when learning that an arrest has been made in the kidnapping . \\nfueled by angry talk about getting back at the kidnapper and of having the deputy inadvertently telling them of the ransom money found on the suspect , a mob storms the jail , burns it down and dynamites it when they can\\'t get through to the prisoner\\'s jail cell . \\nthe sheriff called the governor for the national guard , but one of his political advisers countermanded that request , saying it wouldn\\'t look right for the governor in an election year to call out troops for those he wants to vote for him . \\nsomehow joe escapes , but his dog rainbow dies . \\nkatherine hears what has happened on the radio and rushes to the neighboring town of strand only to see him engulfed by flames in his cell , and becomes convinced that he died . \\nthe next day the newspapers announce that the guilty kidnapper confesses . \\njoe makes his way back to chicago and tells his brothers , who are startled to see him alive , that he wants revenge . \\nhe thereby supplies his brothers with the names of the 22 leaders in the lynch mob . \\nan ambitious district attorney ( walter abel ) prosecutes the 22 for murder . \\nkatherine , not knowing he\\'s alive , remains in a state of shock , but is asked to be a witness that she saw joe burning to death . \\nthe defense claims that it can\\'t be a charge of murder without a corpse . \\nthe trial proves to be interesting , as the citizens in this close-knit , respectable community , lie under oath , providing alibis for each other to prove they couldn\\'t have been at the jail . \\nthe sheriff also lies , saying he can\\'t identify anyone in the mob . \\nbut proof comes by way of a newsreel cameraman who caught the whole incident on film . \\nas for proof of the corpse , an anonymous letter is addressed to the judge enclosed with the wedding ring katherine gave joe . \\nin the note , memento is misspelled , which makes katherine realize that joe is alive . \\nwhen the sentence is announced , 20 of the accused are found guilty of murder , but joe marches into the courtroom and gives a pious speech about what happened . \\nkatherine forgives him , and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have . \\nbut don\\'t blame lang for all the changes in the film , of trying to take the town off the hook by introducing this wild revenge motive . \\nmgm couldn\\'t bear to have it made the way lang wanted it , that is , by having tracy die in the lynching . \\ninstead they wanted to stop short of condemning so many small american towns where lynchings actually do occur , and they thereby meddled throughout the entire script . \\nto lang\\'s credit , even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference , it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook . \\nhis portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised . \\nyou couldn\\'t help get the feeling that the citizens didn\\'t care that much that they almost lynched an innocent man , but cared more about protecting the reputation of their town and would do anything to keep their 22 vigilantes from going to jail , even perjuring themselves . \\ntheir reaction to seeing joe alive was satisfying only in that it meant they weren\\'t going to be convicted . \\nlang by no means implies that the town has learned its lesson from this incident . \\nhe does imply that a dark side to joe wilson has been exposed , and the innocent , jovial good-guy , seen in the beginning of the film , has been largely altered forever by this traumatic experience . \\n',\n",
       " b' \" . . . because i\\'m a scientist . \\nthat\\'s what we do ! \" \\n--- dr . alexander mccabe ( bob gunton ) , in response to why he created evil bats . \\nalright folks , stop me if you\\'ve heard this one : genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals , assisted by a specialist in the particular animal\\'s field , must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth . \\noh yeah , the military is on their way to bomb the town as well , so they are running short on time . \\nsound familiar ? \\nsuch is the plot of the destination films release of bats . \\ndina meyer stars as the \" bat specialist \" sheila , who is pulled from her research ( along with her annoying sidekick , played with irritating deftness by leon ) in order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently . \\nwith the help of the local sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) , a cdc official ( carlos jacott ) , and a scientist ( bob gunton ) , sheila discovers it is indeed bats ( who have been genetically altered by gunton\\'s character to be more aggressive and omnivorous , in order to be used as a military weapon ! ) . \\ni have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film . \\nthere\\'s not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good . \\nin this respect , the film never disappointed me . \\nthis film reaches a level that transcends the \" so bad it\\'s good \" level and borders on the downright insane . \\nthe effects are awful , the script is contrived , and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously ( i think ) . \\ni challenge anyone to sit through the scene , where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner , with a straight face . \\nthankfully , the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with . \\ndina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in ( johnny mnemonic , dragonheart , and starship troopers . . . \\nthe latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit ) , and this one is no exception . \\nwhile one never really gets the impression that meyer\\'s character could be a bat expert in reality , one never really cares to doubt it either . \\nshe gives as good a performance as could be expected , plus she\\'s nice to look at for an hour and a half . \\nlou diamond phillips is also serviceable here , as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero . \\nalthough when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what\\'s going on in town , for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats . \\nthe only bad performance in the film is that of leon\\'s . \\nhe is relegated to the \" i\\'m not sticking around here ! \" \\ncharacter and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays . \\nanyone who can\\'t immediately tell that bob gunton ( the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films ) is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised , but i highly doubt it . \\neven if he hadn\\'t been the villain in just about every film he\\'s ever been in , so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever . \\nin fact , his death is welcome , because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale . \\nif the plot doesn\\'t sound ridiculous to you yet , then check out these little tidbits : a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol . \\nan entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor\\'s orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated , causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force , killing several townsfolk . \\na government official blows off shelia\\'s instructions ( to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats\\' cave that will kill all of them off ) by pulling a night job , resulting in the death of an entire military unit . \\na cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it . \\nfinally , to top it all off , this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it\\'s single screen theater ( for reference , our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens , and we\\'re lucky to even get kevin smith\\'s dogma ) . \\nthe most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill-conceived bat puppets . \\nwhile the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing ( making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what\\'s going on ) , the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more low-key . \\ntherefore we the audience get loving close-ups of the most unrealistic , rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film . \\nbeing able to see the puppeteer\\'s arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse . \\nafter all of this , if you still decide bats might be the movie for you , don\\'t say you haven\\'t been warned . \\ntrust me when i say that it\\'s a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through . \\ni just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in . \\nshe\\'s definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these . \\n',\n",
       " b' \" sometimes the \\'green mile\\' seems sooooo long . \" \\nindeed . \\nand any filmmaker with a three hour movie who ends it with that gem of dialogue should expect to see it quoted in a review . \\non a more positive note , let me add that sometimes the green mile is almost good enough to make us forget its length . \\nthe mile in question ( green due to its faded lime-colored linoleum ) leads from the prison cell to \" old sparky , \" the electric chair where executions were carried out at louisiana\\'s cold mountain penitentiary in 1935 . \\npaul edgecomb ( tom hanks , you\\'ve got mail ) is the head guard of e-block , otherwise known as death row . \\nkeeping his prisoners calm as they await the carrying out of their sentence is his primary responsibility . \\nit is a responsibility which he capably delegates to the other guards on his watch by insisting they \" talk to \" the convicts instead of yelling at them . \\nthis practice leads to an unusual camaraderie between the guards and the men behind their bars . \\ninto his charge comes one john coffey ( michael clarke duncan , armageddon ) , a seven foot tall gentle giant who has been convicted of the rape and murder of two young girls . \\nimmediately , paul senses something different about this prisoner . \\nperhaps its the way he asked for a night light because he is frightened of the dark . \\nor perhaps it is the mystical healing powers he demonstrates as he \" takes back \" paul\\'s bladder infection thereby restoring him to health . \\nbased on steven king\\'s 1996 serialized novel , the green mile does offer other characters who have stories to be told : eduard delacroix ( michael jeter , patch adams ) , is a frail cajun convict who befriends and trains a mouse to do circus tricks ; percy wetmore ( doug hutchison , a time to kill ) , is a young and sadistic guard sitting on a transfer to a more lucrative position because he has yet to see a prisoner \" fry \" up close ; and hal moores ( james cromwell , babe : pig in the city ) is the compassionate warden for whom , despite all the executions he\\'s witnessed , death never loomed as large as when his own wife was diagnosed with a tumor . \\nwhile it is mr . hanks \" everyman \" performance at the center of the film which gives it the anchor to hold our interest for 180 minutes , it is the performances of his supporting cast that are most worth noting . \\nall involved do credible work in their respective roles , most especially mr . duncan , who turns in an impressive , fully realized characterization . \\nif only the story were more credible . \\nwriter/director frank darabont ( the shawshank redemption ) has crafted a flawed fantasy/allegory of sorts ; one which is more spiritualistic than spiritual , relying on a preternatural mysticism rather than a genuine and godly spiritual power . \\nmr . darabont also overplays his hand considerably in the manipulation of our affection towards and association with his characters . \\nwas it an accidental omission that the first two inmates who walked the green mile were being punished for crimes never disclosed ? \\nby not knowing the reason for the condemned convicts\\' presence on e-block , the audience never gets the sense of the justice which is being carried out , making the death penalty appear cruel and unwarranted . \\nthis is especially true during the gruesome depiction of the second execution which was horribly botched . \\nmuch has also been made of coffey\\'s christ-like ability to heal but unlike the numerous healings which are recorded in the scriptures , coffey\\'s powers are shrouded in mystery , taking on the feel of a circus trick , coupled with a voodoo-like \" i feel your pain \" transference . \\nin contrast , there is no mystery associated with the healing that is from god . \\nthe genuine \" gifts of healing \" listed in 1 corinthians 12 is just one of the nine manifestations of holy spirit and can be operated by any spiritually instructed man or woman in accordance with the knowledge and wisdom of god . \\ntrue spiritual healing ( with few exceptions ) requires the committed believing of both the healer as well as the one being healed . \\nsuch believing comes not from the shrouded secrets of mysticism , but from the revealed word of god . \\n',\n",
       " b'you think that these people only exist in the movies , but trust me , they\\'re as real as life . \\ni once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person\\'s brain with microwaves . \\nthen i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections . \\ni even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted . \\nthese people had what are known as \" conspiracy theories \" - ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public . \\na little imagination goes a long way . \\nin richard donner\\'s conspiracy theory , jerry fletcher ( mel gibson ) is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything . \\nhis latest , that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle , might sound outrageous to us , but is all in a day\\'s work for him . \\nhe combs the newspaper , looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings-on behind the scenes , and from there jerry draws his conclusions . \\nupstanding citizen that he is , he tries to convince alice sutton ( julia roberts ) of the justice department that the president must be warned . \\nlucky gal , alice , who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since . \\nwhat she doesn\\'t know is that jerry\\'s interest in her is far more than , well , professional . \\nhe goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment . \\nbut when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry\\'s ideas and his limited-circulation \" conspiracy theory \" newsletter , he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice\\'s help . \\none of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action-thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action , nor a significant number of thrills . \\npart of this is a result of the film\\'s slow pace . \\nit takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice , and even once that is over with , the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement . \\nat over two hours , this film could have been significantly condensed and had it\\'s running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour , but even then , the action scenes would not be able to save the film . \\ninstead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces , we\\'re treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite \" black elements \" : black helicopter , men in black action suits and body armor , black vehicles - you know the drill . \\nthey come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons , but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time . \\nbig deal , we\\'ve seen it all before . \\nwatching the film , i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination , but i was out of luck . \\nnow , when i say it took forever to set up the \" relationship \" between jerry and alice , i completely mean what one person is relative to the other , and not romantic involvement . \\noh , donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie , the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other , but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring . \\nyou see , there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies ( also directed by donner ) than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory . \\nthe two just don\\'t click , and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether ( like finding out he\\'s been stalking her ) , the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced . \\nthe script in general also seems forced , like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it , then took it and forced it upon us . \\ndialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable , to the point that i almost stopped listening . \\neven gibson\\'s usual gift for ad lib couldn\\'t punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest , although one of jerry\\'s theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing . \\nunfortunately , much of what\\'s discussed in the film is not inherently important to what\\'s going on , but instead filler that starts out with potential , but ends up just being extraneous because it\\'s never followed through . \\nfor example , jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station . \\nhe even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break ( hence the water in a subway station ) , and that the coroner should check the man\\'s lungs for chlorine . \\nthis is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him . \\nyou know what happens then ? \\nnothing , zip , nada . \\nno follow-up whatsoever , so what\\'s the significance ? \\nokay , here\\'s another one . \\na couple of well known ( real life ) assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j . d . salinger novel \" the catcher in the rye \" . \\njerry also has a bunch of copies . \\nwhenever he goes into a bookstore , he has to buy one . \\nleaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin , we\\'re never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin . \\nnot when we find out about his salinger collection , not when he goes to the bookstore , not later on when we get the answer to our first question . \\nthe point becomes totally extraneous . \\noh , did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film ? \\nyeah , he plays this government psychiatrist named dr . jonas who may or may not be a bad guy . \\nthat\\'s about it . \\nfor all the presence this usually marvelous actor has , he\\'s nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory . \\nyou can just lump him in with the supporting players , with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi . \\nthis guy was really likable , and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time . \\nokay , here\\'s my theory . \\nthis really started out as a great film , but some of its jokes were actually true ! \\nthe government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security , and this was what was left over . \\n',\n",

       " b'since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they\\'re portraying , it\\'s fitting to say that \" beloved \" come as a real shock as a film . \\nit\\'s confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i\\'ve seen all year , and that\\'s not necessarily because of the three-hour running time . \\n \" beloved \" is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , \" beloved \" comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based ) . \\n \" beloved \" tells the story of an ex-slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children . \\nwhen the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family . \\nsethe is proud , though , and will not move . \\nher sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation . \\na couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex-slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging . \\nhe has been wandering around since he left the plantation , and when he enters the house , it turns red and becomes incredibly hot . \\nwhen he remarks about what he thinks is evil , sethe replies \" it ain\\'t evil . \\nit\\'s just sad . \" \\nsome more time passes , and paul d has become a fervent member of the household , and the ghost disappears . \\nbut when they return one day from going out , they discover a young woman sitting in the house . \\nher name is beloved , and as played by thandie newton , she has almost zero motor skills . \\nshe stumbles around , half-grabbing onto things and knocking them over , and when she speaks , she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk . \\nthey let her into her house , and she begins to turn things upside down . \\n \" beloved \" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story . \\nmost of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic , low-lit room , with the occasional flash to the past , where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern-day psychoanalysts . \\nsethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation , which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands , with her nipples being licked , prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it , \" they took my milk ! \" \\nworst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back . \\nshe runs to the barn near by , carrying her four children , and when her old owners burst in , they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don\\'t leave them alone . \\nwhen she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film , she says she doesn\\'t regret it . \\nshe killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did , and she has convinced herself she did the right thing . \\nof course , beloved is really her daugher materialized , though we aren\\'t flat out told that until later on in the film . \\nbeloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long . \\nthus , \" beloved \" becomes a sorta-redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci-fi classic , \" solaris , \" where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife , who commited suicide years before , has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system . \\nthat film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories , how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past , and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us , it would control us completely . \\n \" beloved \" moves along freely , without a lot of explanation , and for the most part , this is extremely respectable . \\nthe most interesting films are the ones that don\\'t explain everything for us , leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense . \\nsethe is never fully explained as a character , but we understand all her actions since she\\'s being played by oprah winfrey . \\nit\\'s been well over a decade since her last major performance in \" the color purple , \" but judging from these two films , i\\'ll bet she\\'s one of the best actresses working today . . . if \\nshe was strictly an actress . \\nher talk show , which i suppose is a great entity , has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress , and that\\'s a shame because she brings so much to this movie . \\nemotion . \\nsadness . \\nstrength . \\nwatching the strong sethe , who\\'s so afraid of the past that she\\'s built a rather strong protective coating around herself , break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great . \\nshe makes it real . \\nthat\\'s not to say this is a perfect film . \\nin fact , i\\'d wager to say that the fact that it\\'s confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is . \\nwhile oprah\\'s performance is powerful and easily sympathetic ( and i\\'m dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february ) , the structure of the film , which doesn\\'t show what happened to her children till halfway through the film , prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film . \\nit doesn\\'t necessarily move as though they\\'re memories of one particular character , and by the end , it has lost control over sethe , and as she takes to bed , we are unable to truly identify with her anymore . \\nbut despite its tediousness , perhaps that\\'s the point . \\nthe distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start , since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable , and it needs to get back with reality . \\nand for the most part , this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be . \\njonathan demme\\'s direction is bizarre , in nature with the story , and he creates the right mood , making it a tough film to sit through , making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters . \\nthere\\'s more to admire here , like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization , just like they would be in real life ; and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering , but laced with a touch of optimism . \\nthe acting , not only from winfrey , is amazing , and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination . \\neveryone has been raving about thandie newton\\'s performance , and how it should be rewarded . \\nhowever , it must be noted that out of everyone , she had the easiest part . \\nact like a baby . \\nthrow things . \\nstumble around . \\nchew food with your mouth open . \\ni do think there\\'s another performance worthy of oscar conisderation , but it\\'s kimberly elise , as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane , and has to carry the burden of her mother\\'s loss of reality towards the end . \\nit\\'s not that newton isn\\'t great : she\\'s as annoying and wacky as the role demands . \\nit\\'s just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better . \\ndespite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it , and not that of writer morrison or director demme , \" beloved \" has still not done well . \\ncosting , i think , around ninety million dollars , it has since grossed about twenty-two . \\nunfortunately , this film is a little too intense for viewers , even for me , and i can stand almost anything ( i recently viewed the 2 1/2 hour long epic \" caligula , \" the worst film i have ever seen in my life , and did it in a mere 2 sittings ) . \\nalthough i respect \" beloved , \" i can\\'t say that i really enjoyed it . \\n',\n",

\" \\nthe film is about two individuals who have come together , spent a good chunk of their lives together , and shows when our main characters are \" him \" and \" her \" ( during the bad times ) , and when they are \" us \" ( during the good times ) . \\nthe story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day . \\nben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don\\'t want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer , or at least say they don\\'t , love each other anymore . \\nben , a cartoonist , and katie , a crossword puzzle writer , have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage , as they have grown to follow different views on life , family , and marriage . \\nkatie is the more organized , sophisticated type , who wants to plan everything out , while ben is a spontaneous , adventurous individual who doesn\\'t mind doing things differently than they were planned . \\nthe story of us plays out nicely , as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist , told to the viewer through flashbacks . \\nas the film progresses , it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist , with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage . \\nthis method is highly effective , as we see the characters changing from year to year , slowly growing apart . \\nthrough the flashbacks , we get to see the story of them through both of the character\\'s eyes , and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like , as the story of us has three dimensional , believable main characters . \\nthe screenplay , written by jessie nelson ( stepmom ) and alan zweibel ( dragnet ) , is a touching , down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer , much like another one of nelson\\'s films , stepmom . \\nthe script has an open honesty and outlook on life , one that is so realistic , you feel uncomfortable at many times , because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar , as most families these days most go through the hard times , as ben and katie must . \\nif it wasn\\'t for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote , which are rugged and certainly flawed , the story of us would have been this year\\'s best picture . \\nbruce willis , a usual action/adventure star , has certainly turned himself around in the past year- he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies , to a distinguished , sophisticated actor , as in last summer\\'s the sixth sense ; and now in the story of us , willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script . \\nalthough i wouldn\\'t pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan , willis handles himself nicely , and shines in a few of the film\\'s most powerful scenes , enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season . \\nwhere to start about michelle pfeiffer ?

       " b'there\\'s more to a quilt than fabric and thread--each patchwork design has its own unique story ( or stories ) to tell . \\nin how to make an american quilt , the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse ( proof ) , we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality . \\nall the sorrows , joys , longings , sufferings , and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and , as their bittersweet memories are given expression , one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future . \\nmotion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals ; how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative . \\nthe \" quilting bee \" consists of seven members : sisters gladys ( ann bancroft ) and hy ( ellen burstyn ) ; sophia ( lois smith ) , a woman known for frightening children ; emma ( jean simmons ) , the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man ; constance ( kate nelligan ) , who has been having an affair with emma\\'s husband ; anna ( maya angelou ) , the leader of the group ; and marianna ( alfre woodard ) , anna\\'s daughter . \\nthe project they\\'re busy with is the wedding quilt for hy\\'s granddaughter , finn ( winona ryder ) , who has just become engaged . \\nshe\\'s spending the summer with hy and gladys , and away from her fiance , to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants , and whether it\\'s better to marry a friend or a lover . \\none of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast . \\nfrom winona ryder , ann bancroft , ellen burstyn , and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn , claire danes , and kate capshaw , this film is overflowing with realized talent . \\nthe performances are good enough , in fact , to cover up many of the script\\'s weaknesses . \\nhow to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable , if affecting , tale of love across the generations--a sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club , with a dash of fried green tomatoes added . \\nthere are probably too many characters . \\nso , instead of really getting to know a few of them , we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives . \\nwe learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy , and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible . \\nthere are other episodes as well : the love of anna\\'s life , marianna\\'s soul mate , and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friend\\'s husband . \\nthe sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finn\\'s story : whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger . \\nthere is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt . \\nthe stories are all well-told , but it\\'s difficult to really connect with the characters--their moments pass so quickly . \\nwhile we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals , our emotional investment is tenuous . \\nthere isn\\'t enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way , and many of the personalities and relationships feel half- formed , like a quilt with patches missing . \\nto put it bluntly , while i enjoyed watching this film , it didn\\'t \" do much \" for me . \\non the whole , how to make an american quilt is a nicely-understated drama that has a lot to say about love , passion , and monogamy in relationships . \\nfinn\\'s segment is by far the most compelling , because she\\'s the focal point : her actions are shaped by everyone else\\'s experiences . \\nthe other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees . \\nif there\\'s a disappointment here , it\\'s that the script doesn\\'t have more resonance , but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional . \\n',\n",
       " b'with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the \" film noir \" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller\\'s crossing , blood simple ) , and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy ) . \\ntheir latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film . \\nthe main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn\\'t quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who\\'s wise to the world , but he doesn\\'t really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax . \\nthat main character is jeffrey \" the dude \" lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film\\'s rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as \" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county . \" \\nthe dude is unemployed , needless to say , and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends , walter ( john goodman ) , a borderline-psychotic who\\'s in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody\\'s cheating in a bowling match ( \" has the whole world gone crazy ? ! \" he shouts at a suspected cheater ) , and donny ( steve buscemi ) , who\\'s always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( \" donny , you have no frame of reference here ! \" ) . \\nthese three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of \" hotel california \" and , if it\\'s possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter . \\nif that doesn\\'t give you a good idea of this film\\'s absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude\\'s rug . \\nthey\\'ve mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the \" big \" lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) . \\nthe dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn\\'t have any luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $1 million ransom . \\nunfortunately , walter gets involved and fouls up the drop-off , and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers , the dude\\'s car gets stolen , along with the briefcase containing the money . \\nsoon , the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german \" nihilists \" who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place ; the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn . \\nmeanwhile , the big lebowski\\'s daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist avant-garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked , wants to recover the money for her family . \\nthe plot , however , is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc . \\nthe previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival\\'s \" run through the jungle , \" and it fits : the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases , with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble ( usually unsuccessfully ) . \\nthe film doesn\\'t feature quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the coens\\' other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor , particularly in the dude\\'s dream sequences and acid flashbacks ) , but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact . \\nthe film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this \" jungle \" but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution . \\nthere\\'s also a noticeable ( but not too heavy-handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski , which , incidentally , takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin ; at the beginning , we see george bush on television making his \" this aggression will not stand \" speech . \\nthe coens take aim at just about every elite l . a . subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( \" the bums will always lose ! \" \\nshouts the big lebowski at one point ) , the porn industry , the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their \" peaceful beach community , \" and so on . \\nby the end , we really start to admire the dude , who almost certainly harbors the least \" aggression \" of anyone in this story ; his passive resistance ( emphasis on \" passive , \" albeit ) to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters . \\nhe also turns out to have a pretty well-functioning brain in his head , even if he doesn\\'t like to use it very much ; his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he\\'s getting a run around , and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end . \\nthe coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness , but they don\\'t just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either . \\ni think that , more than anything , is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy : it manages to approach characters like the dude and , to some extent , walter , with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter-brained . \\naudience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un-dynamic duo by the end of the movie , given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first . \\n \" it\\'s good knowin\\' he\\'s out there , the dude , takin\\' it easy , \" posits the narrator towards the end . \\ni dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken . \\n',\n",

       " b'for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer , hard boiled , face off ) appears to have made an exciting , elegant , charming spy thriller , kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them . \\nsadly , as the picture progresses , the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two-hour long episode of magyuver . \\nand not a particularly good one at that . \\nwhat went wrong ? \\nmi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it\\'ll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise\\'s firing gun just so they can die really cool . \\nearly on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic . \\nin one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other\\'s eyes with come hither sexuality ? ? ? just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance , coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff . \\nprior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain , sans scaffolding , then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another . \\nwhy ? \\ni haven\\'t the foggiest . \\ni doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply . \\nwith mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects . \\nit\\'s possible that these \" spies \" could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off , though of course this is never explored . \\nthe scenes i\\'ve described are really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character . \\ngod forbid . \\nwoo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial-like visuals . \\nstill in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish . \\ncruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is ) . \\nbetween the frantic dancing , woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact . \\nthe scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us . \\nsure it\\'s all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product . \\nthandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that\\'s about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \\\\ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight . \\nthey flirt and exchange obvious double entendres . \\nnewton bats her eyes flirtatiously . \\ncruise grins a little too slyly . \\nthe cruise character , ethan hunt , has been drastically altered since the first film . \\nhere cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1 . \\nhe\\'s cool and dashing , which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90\\'s ) . \\nsadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise\\'s initial \" i\\'m the man ! \" \\ncharm and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug . \\nmi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won\\'t stop . \\nthe whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a john woo film , but alas this particular battle could\\'ve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the \" symbolic \" pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture ) . \\nwe\\'ve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand . \\nit isn\\'t done any differently here . \\nthe action is pure hard target \\\\ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind . \\nhe\\'s cool for sure but he\\'s made to be as empty as the movie . \\nthe actor isn\\'t used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one . \\nwhen he\\'s not beaming away , he\\'s staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell , but woo\\'s editing seriously undermines the effort . \\nhe fetishizes cruise\\'s angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof . \\ni half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he\\'s really austin powers . \\nin a classic woo action moment , ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death . \\nthe gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise , basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does ) . \\nthe lead bad guy ( played by the appropriately british dougray scott ) and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken ?

' \\nin down with america , the line `roswell' is highly absent . \\nwith an about ten minute running time , down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich ? that the conspiracy films fell into , makes jokes at them at the same time , and provides us with funny and memorable characters . \\nagain , i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldn't care less about . \\nthe film , as previously stated , concerns a federal agent ( peter roach ) , an obsessed librarian ( meri stevens ) , a mystery man ( joe kaczkowski ) , and two people obsessed with silence in the library ( robb sherman , kevin flowers ) . \\nthe plot : a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in ? a public library where it can be viewed by all . \\nfrom there we go into a delightful parody . \\nthe federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth , the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books . \\nwe spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast . \\nalthough the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to `no-name' , it ends up being the no-name people who do a good job , delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out . \\nfor once , i don't have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online . \\ni can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l'auto and les x-files and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself . \\nit's almost as much fun as the film . \\n\",\n",
       " b'bob the happy bastard\\'s quickie review : \\ni must admit , no doubt\\'s single \" new \" is quite catchy . \\nit was bouncy and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon , the man who had brought us the humorous swingers a little while back . \\nthe result ? \\na movie that\\'s just as good as that song , really . \\nit follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend . \\nfirst we hear about a grocery bagger ( sara polley ) who runs into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave ( with bad results , as a drug dealer feels he\\'s been swindled by her ) ; then comes the story of an english grocery store worker ( same store ) who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends , where sex , gunplay , and stolen car trouble come into play ; then we see the story of two gay movie actors ( played by scott wolf and jay mohr ) who deal with a cop\\'s strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl ( sara ) with their car ; and , finally , we come to another grocery worker ( katie holmes ) who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer ( the one mentioned earlier ) . \\nreally , it\\'s all confusing to keep track of in review format , your best bet is to just , well , go . \\nthe movie features some very good acting from all angles , and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product . \\nthe dialogue is pretty snappy and the resolution is pretty well realized , not going for the sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending . \\nthink of it as a , well , ending . \\nthe intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie , as it\\'s never really confusing and tells different sides of the story , like sliding doors kinda did . \\nhowever , it\\'s better suited for the younger generation who want a little spice in their flicks , which sliding doors kinda isn\\'t . \\n',\n",

interest in insects and other outdoor life . \\none day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him . \\nher name is maggie , a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty , with

know one another . \\nthey gradually become good friends , and spend the summer together doing various things , such as studying insects ( namely locusts , who come out of hiding once every 17 years ) , playing tennis , and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover . \\nlucas is obviously in love with maggie , and while she is charmed by him , it's clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend . \\nthis is not clear to lucas , however . \\nhe still beleives that maggie is his soulmate , and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what's about to happen . \\nwe soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally . \\nthey throw him on stage , right in front of his beloved maggie . \\nsurprisingly , he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around , but he takes it too far , and is embarassed in front of the entire school . \\nthe next scene is brilliant . \\nmaggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally . \\nshe tries to talk to him as if nothing happened . \\nhe rails back against her , in a cruel unfair fashion . \\nin lesser movies this would've turned into a confrontation between the two characters . \\nbut maggie is written smarter than that . \\nshe understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him . \\nnext we are

tender undertsanding demeanor , not to mention his shirtless body . \\nthis scene is so delicate and sweet , but cappie still has a girlfriend , preventing either one from acting on their desires .

\\n ( diedre\\'s therapist wishes to have her recommitted , so she decides to visit diedre , alone , in her new apartment -- never realizing , of course , that it\\'s not her\\'s . \\ntherapists typically are catatonically brain-dead in these movies ) . \\nhaving successfully snuffed the woman out , diedre looks at the body and says : \" what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session , dr . jones ? \\noh , that\\'s right . \\n\\'i\\'m sorry , but your time is up ! \\' \" \\nthis is what passes for humor in the film . \\nthe audience doesn\\'t necessarily laugh but groan ( the type of groan that suggests the audience can\\'t believe they\\'re watching this crap -- although watching it they are ) . \\nnick mancuso\\'s chainsmoking , nervous-wreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butler\\'s character delivers , but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief . \\nin between drags off his cigarette , for instance , in one of the movie\\'s best scenes , david tries to explain to his lawyer what a creep his ex-wife is . \\nin exaggerated exasperation , he nearly shouts \" the woman is a cuckoo-bird ! \" \\n ( trust me , it is funny in context . ) \\nand so , the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion . \\ni won\\'t reveal the ending specifically ( though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film review ) , but i will say that the ex has one of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film . \\nmolly and david own a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds ! \\nmolly , at one point in the film , not-so-brilliantly observes , after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her family\\'s to spy upon them , that \" she\\'s crazy . \" \\nyou\\'d be pretty crazy too if you\\'d rented this turkey . \\ni\\'d avoid it unless it\\'s on tv and you come across it . \\nif you do , you may want to watch it , groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot , and feel good that you didn\\'t spend money renting it . \\n',\n",

       " b'director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one ) . \\nfilm is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story , but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something . \\nbut most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story . \\nso whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential , the film almost automatically deserves a good review . \\nand when they add a fascinating story to it , you have nearly perfect entertainment . \\nfincher\\'s the game is no exception to this . \\nthe game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time . \\nfincher hasn\\'t made a film since \" seven , \" his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever . \\nso it is about time he made another film . \\nand what a ride it is . \\nthe game isn\\'t quite as powerful as \" seven , \" but in some ways it is better . \\noverall , the game could have used a little more clarity , or a little more uncertainty . \\nit walks a line of insanity and reality , but it never goes either way until the very end . \\nthe outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events , and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight . \\nunfortunately , unlike \" the usual suspects , \" we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening , whether it be true or false . \\nhowever , this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent . \\nthe game is told completely from its main character\\'s point of view . \\nnicholas van orton ( michael douglas ) is a high-strung and isolated businessman . \\nhe lives alone in his giant mansion , divorced from his wife elizabeth , and is celebrating his 48th birthday ; the same age at which his father committed suicide at , in the same mansion . \\nfor his 48th birthday , conrad ( sean penn ) , the rebel of the family , gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs : consumer recreation services . \\n \" it will make your life fun again , \" his brother promises . \\nas skeptical as nicholas is , he is somewhat intrigued , and annoyed by the lack of information--something this businessman hates . \\nseeing a billboard in an office , he decides to visit the mysterious company . \\njim feingold ( james rebhorn ) greets nicholas and guides him through the sign-up process , which consists of psych-tests , physicals , emotional responses , and other mind games . \\n \" each game is suited to each person\\'s emotional and psychological needs , \" explains feingold . \\none day , nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests . \\neven more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up , he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company . \\nwhat he doesn\\'t realize is that the game has already begun . \\nthe phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas\\' way . \\nhow he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive . \\nthe detail involved in fincher\\'s shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them . \\nwith \" seven , \" fincher had almost every single shot mean something . \\nhe also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to . \\ncompared to \" seven , \" though , the game is light and comical . \\nbecause of this film\\'s sense of humor and self-awareness , nothing can be taken quite seriously . \\nso don\\'t try to make much sense of what goes on in the game , because it doesn\\'t want you to . \\nwhat does make sense is the final revelation--when everything becomes apparent and clear . \\nif taken as it is , the game\\'s ending makes complete sense . \\nbut if you try and critique every minute detail , then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility . \\nperhaps that is the reason i docked the film . \\nwhile trying to remain realistic and plausible , the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen . \\nwe don\\'t really care if douglas\\' character lives or not because it isn\\'t believable . \\nthe ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously , but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is , you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller . \\nmichael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas . \\ndouglas has played lonely businessmen before , but here he adds another level to his performance . \\nhis character , who is normally level-headed and relies on facts , is forced to trust nobody . \\ncan he believe the waitress he bumped into ? \\nwhat about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place ? \\ndouglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well , and gives one of his best performances ( even better than his \" falling down \" persona ) . \\nthe supporting cast is essential in this film , and casting was critical . \\nsean penn is always good , and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas\\' brother . \\ndeborah kara unger ( from \" crash \" ) is the waitress he bumps into , and her performance is extremely good . \\nin fact , she almost steals the film from douglas . \\njames rebhorn portrays his character very well , and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas\\' predicament . \\nanother good performance comes from armin mueller-stahl ( from \" shine \" ) as the book editor . \\nbut considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game , he not only commands this cast , but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life . \\nthe game is rated r for language , violence , some gore , and some nudity and drugs . \\nwhat is essential for this film to work is the writing . \\njohn brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue , and some very funny moments . \\nthis screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects\\' did . \\nhowever , the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot . \\nand if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen , you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year\\'s best films . \\n',\n",

i\\'d wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original . \\nmost of the vocal performances are first-rate . \\ntom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work . \\nhowever , one voice-over also stands out as horribly miscast . \\nkelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector . \\nalthough he does a lot of voice-over work in commercials and on \" the simpsons \" ( as sideshow bob ) , grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice . \\nhe doesn\\'t have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete . \\nthe animation is even better than in the first . \\nespecially impressive were the textures of the figures . \\nwe can now see the difference between flesh and plastic ; in the first movie the people looked just like the toys , but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint . \\nwe can also see that bo peep is porcelain . \\nas you can tell from the long-winded phrasing common in the merchandising -- \" disney and pixar\\'s \\'toy story 2\\' \" -- this is pixar\\'s coming out party . \\nto celebrate they appended their first project , a hilarious short about two desklamps and a rubber ball , to the beginning of the movie . \\nthey made the short in 1986 , which is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then . \\non the downside , \" toy story 2 \" follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale , and some sections tend to drag . \\noverall , though , i had a great time and found \" story 2 \" to be a worthy successor to the first \" toy story . \" \\nbottom line : this one really is fun for the whole family ! \\n',\n",

\\nbecause there is more . \\nmuch , much more . \\nand this is a movie that , without credits , is little over 90 minutes and feels only like an hour . \\n \" the whole nine yards \" is an ultimately unsatisfying and empty-headed excursion into well-worn terrain already set by far superior pictures . \\nhow the cast , most of which are respectable actors , got caught up in such a cliched , deficient film remains a mystery , unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynn\\'s 1985 comedy classic , \" clue : the movie . \" \\ngoing into the theater , preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable , but by the twenty-minute mark , when i had chuckled once and laughed nary a single time , it was clear this production was in serious trouble . \\nsince the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot , and the screenplay , inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner , collapses with every failing \" comedy \" bit , the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and , frequently , entertainment value . \\n \" the whole nine yards \" is neither facetious nor , aside from the subplot about jill\\'s shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman , inventive , and more often than not , just lies there , the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector , but never igniting any sort of spark . \\na few select actors do what they can with the material , while others make no impact at all . \\non the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters : matthew perry and bruce willis . \\nperry , innocuously enjoyable on tv\\'s \" friends , \" plays the same exact sitcom-style character in all of his movies ( from 1997\\'s \" fools rush in \" to 1999\\'s \" three to tango \" ) , and it has become a crushing bore . \\nmeanwhile , willis makes next to no impression , and because of the limited guise of his jimmy \" the tulip \" tudeski , oftentimes disappears into the background . \\ntheir three female counterparts fare noticeably better . \\nbest of all is natasha henstridge , far more radiant than in the exploitative \" species \" movies , who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to cynthia . \\nhenstridge has the talent , for sure , to break out of these countless throwaway roles , but first she must fire her agent . \\namanda peet has a lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill , and seems to know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who , thus far , has strived on a career based solely on comedy . \\nit is too bad , then , that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in a climactic scene , with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts . \\nfinally , rosanna arquette is awful as sophie , but something tells me that was her purpose , and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time . \\nalso popping up is michael clarke duncan , fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in \" the green mile , \" as jimmy\\'s largely built friend and fellow killer , frankie figs . \\nwhen \" the whole nine yards \" eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion , one is left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit . \\na great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past , and this one is nothing but a duplication of better films , so what was the point ?

       " b'the following review encompasses two versions of dune : \\ndune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book . \\nthe film\\'s visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative . \\ndune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television . \\nit was disowned by director david lynch but it\\'s considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline . \\nquality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web . \\n * * * the review * * * \\nreleased in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert\\'s cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans . \\ndirector david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico . \\nthe screenplay was lynch\\'s own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected . \\ndune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors . \\nthe key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that\\'s home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange . \\nthe spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe . \\nit extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it . \\nmost importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to \" fold space \" and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish . \\nlynch\\'s film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story\\'s two main strands . \\none is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis . \\nthe second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen . \\nthe deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom . \\nunfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended . \\nthe thinking among universal\\'s oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office . \\nwith lynch\\'s initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made . \\nwhat a great idea ! \\nwhy not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ? \\nthe most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters . \\nthus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul\\'s father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless . \\nthe end result is a distinct chill : we can\\'t warm to most of the cast and we don\\'t care much for them . \\nand it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book . \\ndune is also a very serous film . \\nthe constant \" self-talk \" by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment . \\nthe overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them . \\nhumour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen\\'s mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find . \\nyou may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus\\' star wars trilogy . \\nthe theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however . \\nit still possesses enough of lynch\\'s stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi . \\nspecial effects whiz carlo rambaldi\\'s giant sandworms are an awesome sight . \\nboth the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original . \\nand the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years . \\nwith these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis\\' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses . \\nsee it in the widescreen format if you can . \\nand despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen . \\nsian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who\\'s secret aim is to manipulate paul\\'s destiny for its own shadowy ends . \\nas paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade . \\nthe conclusion ? \\nany assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert\\'s original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker . \\ndavid lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects . \\ndune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release . \\nmany chose to stay away altogether , as the film\\'s disastrous box office showing attests . \\nthe extended version , however , is a rather different beast . \\nin 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition \" director\\'s cut \" of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres . \\nbut , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects . \\nin a way , then , it is partly lynch\\'s own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa . \\nstung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director\\'s guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with \" allen smithee \" , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work . \\nhe also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous \" judas booth \" . \\ncertainly , looking at the results of mca\\'s handiwork there\\'s at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object . \\nbut these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas . \\nmost of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration , both of which fill many holes in the original version\\'s storyline . \\npaul\\'s relationship with his father and associates is more intimate , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously . \\nthe political skulduggery involving the emperor , the spacing guild , the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained . \\npaul\\'s initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably . \\nand as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe . \\nas a piece of storytelling , then , mca tv\\'s version of dune is clearly superior . \\nas a piece of editing , however , it is at times surprisingly inept . \\nthe use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate . \\nthere\\'s some sloppy cutting , too , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order . \\nand the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg . \\nships coming and going , soldiers coming and going ) is at times clearly out-of-context . \\nthis is the kind of thing to which lynch objected , and rightly so . \\nit should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u . s . television . \\nbut the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn\\'t even in herbert\\'s book . \\nthe scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his \" heart plug \" . \\nits a surreal and disturbing episode that\\'s very lynch-esque but adds nothing to what we already know : the baron is a nasty piece of work . \\ndespite its own peculiar flaws , then , the extended version of dune is a generally superior film . \\nall up , it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered , fabricated or newly created sequences . \\nunless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart , the \" alan smithee \" version remains the closest we\\'ll get to what the movie should have been . \\non repeated viewings , one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit . \\nstill , as one of this century\\'s great science-fiction novels , some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen . \\nwith rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga . \\n',\n",

\\nand how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time ? \\ni can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment . \\nthe most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned dragging/salting sequence . \\nthe character in question , dana ( angela zimmely ) , has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated . \\na priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken . \\nhe picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken , taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever . \\nwhen she starts to leave , the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life , walks out , and makes like it wants to be crucified by her . \\nthe presence starts to clap annoyingly ( which continues for the rest of the sequence ) until dana takes off with the strange creature following her . \\nwhen it finally catches up to her , she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ . \\nthe box for the film claims \" because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture , parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18 . \\ncontains nudity and graphic violence \" . \\nwhile both is certainly true , there doesn\\'t seem to be much of either in any large amounts . \\nbesides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump , a semi-graphic self-surgery scene , and two instances of head trauma ( one run over and one melting ) , most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety . \\nas for nudity , it is very sparse , but at least we get to see angela zimmerly ( far and away the most attractive cast member ) before her body is bruised , torn , and bloodied by the dragging incident . \\nice from the sun has been released on vhs by www . b-movie . com . \\nit has been presented in in full-frame only and the transfer ( for a film shot a good deal in 8mm ) is pretty decent . \\nbesides the decent soundtrack ( which is also available from www . b-movie . com ) , a making-of video is also available called on thin ice . \\ni haven\\'t had the opportunity to see the documentary , but i actually would have been interested to see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed , if only to see how director eric stanze ( director of a similar cult film called savage harvest ) , conducted the atmosphere on set . \\n',\n",

       " b'on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo . \\ntwo months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides . \\nthis little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in \" lumumba . \" \\npatrice lumumba\\'s ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , \" lumumba - death of a prophet , \" virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject . \\npeck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader . \\nwe watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men . \\nimages of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image . \\njump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo . \\na third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader . \\nhis small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville . \\nat a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc . \\nas the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation\\'s first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) . \\nthe coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country\\'s vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more . \\nlumumba won\\'t seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government . \\nhis initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination . \\nthe situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad . \\nthis tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries . \\npeck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50\\'s and 60\\'s . \\n ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them . \\nsome colonial masters were better than others . ) \\nthe effort involved in \" lumumba \" is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all . \\nproduction values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget . \\nthe period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique . \\nthe screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman\\'s work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba\\'s life . \\nthe political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches . \\nit concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn\\'t embellish on a larger than life persona . \\nthe family side of patrice\\'s life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child . \\ni know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba . \\nthe story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it . \\nhigh marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character . \\nthe actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions . \\nin true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead . \\n \" lumumba \" is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both . \\nit has more intelligence in its telling than anything i\\'ve seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ . \\n',\n",

\\nwhy , for every fluid physical gesture , do we also see herky-jerky puppet-style motions ? \\nmore to the point , who decided a full-length computer animated movie featuring \" hyperreal \" ( their term , not mine ) humanoids was a good idea ? \\n \" final fantasy \" is based on a phenomenally popular video game i\\'ve never played , with a story straight out of japanese anime , which more often than not leaves me bored and depressed . \\nif you\\'re a fan of either , please spare me your letters , as i will focus solely on the finished film and not its source materials . \\nwith an expression-challenged cast , \" final fantasy \" mixes turgid action scenes with heaps of mystical shit . \\nthe result is ugly , confusing and boring . \\nnote : the following reveals the basic plot . \\nif you want to have a fighting chance of making any sense of the movie , i suggest you read it . \\nearth is at war with aliens that appear to feed on human souls . \\nmost of our planet is devastated , with humans living in a few protected cities . \\nwhile the bulk of the survivors focus on military strategies , aki ross ( voiced by ming-na ) and her mentor , dr . sid ( donald sutherland ) , believe in a more organic approach . \\nthey operate on the notion ( quoting straight from the press kit ) \" that all life forms have signature spirit waves that can be identified and contained . \\naki and dr . sid collect a series of organic specimens whose spirit signatures combined will form a wave of equal and opposite intensity to the spirit wave of the alien force . \\nthe waves will , in effect , cancel each other out and disarm the foreign contagion . \\nthey have collected six of the eight key spirits needed to complete their wave . \\nthey are on a desperate hunt to find the remaining two spirits before their time runs out . \" \\nare you still with me ?

they\\'re cheap ? but animated films can show anything , so why wallow in an industrial trash heap ? \\nthe action scenes and shoot-em-ups don\\'t satisfy either . \\nthe humans move oddly and their facial features are so muted that the talented voice cast can\\'t bring them to life ( in fact , their efforts merely emphasize what we\\'re missing ) . \\naki is especially disappointing ; with her lack of expression and flat delivery , she looks and sound like a brunet version of weena , the eloi girl from 1960\\'s \" the time machine . \" \\ndrab color choices and aliens that appear to have been created in jell-o molds sap the pizzazz from the big set pieces . \\nstudents of computer animation may be fascinated with the technology behind \" final fantasy : the spirits within , \" but i found it sub-par across the board . \\n \" futurama \" does more effective battle visuals , the kids in \" south park \" are far more expressive than these mannequins and any old episode of the contemporary version of \" the outer limits \" does better doom and gloom sci-fi . \\nso who needs this ?

       " b'\\'pleasantville\\' ( 1998 ) taps into hollywood\\'s lack of integrity with subtle messages that can be easily missed \\n ( www . pleasantville . com ) april 2 , 1999 ( friday ) \\ncast : tobey maguire , reese witherspoon , william h . macy , joan allen , j . t . \\nwalsh , jeff daniels \\nmpaa rating : pg-13 for sexual content and thematic elements \\ngenre : drama \\nin my opinion : \\nin short : it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film ; one can easily be misled as to what the real message is . \\nreview : in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population , there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life , such as rain , fire , or emotions . \\nthe town of pleasantville has one adjective : pleasant . \\nthere is no sadness , no fear , no danger , no discomfort , no love , and no hate . \\nput simply , it\\'s a place alanis morissette could really work wonders for . \\nj one big note however is that it is only a 50\\'s sitcom that airs in reruns on an \" oldies \" tv station ? or is it ? \\ni had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed . \\ni found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office . \\nbut it wasn\\'t until months later , when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy \" dollar theaters \" after not having seen it for so long , that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning and perspective than i had previously experienced . \\nit is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some \" healthy \" immorality is not a world at all . \\ninstead , the actual message , which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of , is that a world without immorality doesn\\'t give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself , because everything is automatically right . \\nthere is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made , no space for growth , and never anything new to learn , and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story . \\nnow i\\'m not saying that\\'s necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted , but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be . \\nbesides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews , this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch . \\nthe visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable . \\nafter spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white , it\\'s hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more . \\na truly intelligent addition to it all , however , is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork . \\nthat said , the plot goes as such . \\ndavid and jennifer are two very 90\\'s high school twins with the typical \" relationship \" outline of don\\'t-mess-with-my-life-and-i-won\\'t-mess-with-yours . \\nthey demonstrate the well-known teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today . \\ndavid is the shyer , subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv , while jennifer is the wild , licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation . \\nbut when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters , they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home . \\nnevertheless , jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to a more unrestrained approach to life , and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home , he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed . \\nand , as said earlier , not to flip the town around into some corrupt society , but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them . \\nnot only were difficult choices being brought upon the town , but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place . \\npeople got hurt . \\nthey cried . \\nthey became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves , and that\\'s when their physical world turned colors as well . \\nthis can be looked upon as quite a controversial movie , but to me the message is finally clear . \\ni hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past , and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run , we\\'ll never know what we could have done better . \\nuntil the next great movie i see , i remain sincerely , danielle flynn , imr \\n',\n",
       " b'that thing you do ! \\n ( r ) tom hanks\\'s screenwriting and directorial debut , that thing you do ! , has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment : fun , lively , and oh-so-nice . \\nit is the latter quality , however , that becomes a hindrance , for this \\'60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast . \\nthat thing focuses on the wonders , a teen rock band from erie , pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called , of course , \" that thing you do ! \" \\nthe group\\'s members are , naturally a diverse group : there\\'s brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy ( johnathon schaech ) ; girl-crazy lenny ( steve zahn ) , the lead guitarist ; a goofy , geeky type known only as the bass player ( ethan embry ) ; and the film\\'s center , guy ( tom everett scott ) , the drummer who has aspirations in jazz . \\nalong for the wonders\\' ride to success is jimmy\\'s perpetually neglected galpal , faye ( liv tyler ) . \\nhanks proves to be a capable writer-director , deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964 , which hanks calls \" the last innocent year . \" \\nthe spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music , which , like the other recent period music film , grace of my heart , was expressly written for the film ; hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes--but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger , which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled ( it\\'s still playing in my mind as i write this ) . \\nit should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors , eliciting charming , likable work from the entire cast , most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler , who is remarkable in delivering the film\\'s biggest and best dramatic moment . \\nthe work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early \\'60s ; they do not appear to be \\'90s grungers playacting \" retro . \" \\nyet for all the light , frothy charms of that thing you do ! , it\\'s nearly nice to a fault . \\nwhile this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days , there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting . \\neveryone is so happy , basking in the glow of overnight success , marvelling at it all--except toward the end , but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness , ending on an appropriately feel-good note . \\nthere isn\\'t much of an edge throughout that thing--the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks\\'s turn as the wonders\\' manager--and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it\\'s bland . \\nbut a little niceness goes a long way these days , and there\\'s no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do ! ; it\\'s just about impossible to hate . \\nit\\'s an inoffensive , enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming , if not singing , \" that thing you do ! \" --quite \\npossibly for days . \\nto paraphrase a passage from the song : though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play \" that thing you do ! \" \\n',\n",
       " b'it\\'s an interesting premise . \\nour reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real . \\nin truth , our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains . \\nwhat we see , what we do , everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence . \\nour bodies , severely atrophied , are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet . \\nthe sci-fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along . \\nthe matrix isn\\'t it - the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network , a sham world , the ability to plug one\\'s brain into a computer , has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator , dark city , and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation ) . \\nwhat is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought-provoking . \\nkeanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo , who is plucked out of the artificial world ( known as the matrix ) by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer-generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines . \\nthe group\\'s leader , morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) , has chosen neo because he believes neo is \" the one \" who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence . \\n>from the beginning of the film , we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out . \\nthis , in a lesser movie would be annoying , but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun . \\nwhat is reality ? \\nwhat is a sham ? \\nthe film turns our very perception of life on its side . \\nmore than once , we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality , or live a life of relative bliss , oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings . \\nas viewers , this is intriguing enough , so imagine what it would be like for neo . \\nand who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ? \\nreeves , whom i\\'ve never really cared for as an actor , is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness , and little subtlety . \\nhe was good in speed , for example , but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds . \\nneo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely , so much of my expectation was happily for naught . \\nin a couple of places , the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature , and this is a heavy credit to writers/directors andy and larry wachowski . \\ni mean , since bill and ted\\'s excellent adventure , what movie could you say really \" utilized \" keanu reeves ? \\nmore interesting than reeves is fishburne , who\\'s morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions , and convincingly so . \\nvery surprising for a sci-fi movie . \\nfishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout , as if he always knows what to expect . \\nthis helps to further the aura of his character\\'s proficiency and extensive knowledge . \\nhugo weaving as agent smith , one of the artificial intelligence\\'s anti-intruder programs , is also good playing his deadpan , no-nonsense , kick ass role , which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time . \\nunfortunately , when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row , the nature of his character\\'s speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive . \\ncarrie-anne moss plays trinity , morpheus\\'s number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo . \\nalthough her character is somewhat inconsistent , moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn\\'t in the picture . \\nthere were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects . \\nmany methods of imagery are employed , from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics . \\nof special note is the use of the \" freeze and turn \" effect where the entire scene is frozen , turned , then continued from a new angle . \\nthis is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi-circle , with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends . \\nthe motion cameras film the action , and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once . \\nplace each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second . \\npretty slick . \\nthe matrix drips with style . \\nfrom the clothing to the music to the action , we\\'re watching an exaggerated version of what we\\'re used to . \\nmuch of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film - there\\'s a lot of kung fu , there\\'s a lot of gunplay . \\nwhen a character is letting go with an automatic weapon , much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion . \\nthere\\'s also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados ) , especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects . \\ncombined , it\\'s really like no live-action film i have ever seen . \\nthe film is not without its faults . \\nsome of the scenes and ideas are \" borrowed \" a little too liberally from other films , and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing . \\nsome of the lines are also pretty bad - in one instance , a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying , and it wasn\\'t meant to be a joke . \\nhowever , these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci-fi film that for once does more than merely entertain . \\n',\n",

       " b' \" jaws \" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . \\nthe movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . \\nthen it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams\\' now infamous score . \\ndah-dum . \\nfrom there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . \\nright away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once \" jaws \" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . \\nperhaps what is most outstanding about \" jaws \" is how spielberg builds the movie . \\nhe works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . \\nunlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . \\nuntil then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams\\' music . \\nhe\\'s building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark\\'s arrival is truly terrifying . \\nhe doesn\\'t let us get bored with the imagery . \\nthe first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn\\'t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . \\nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn\\'t want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . \\nbrody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . \\nhooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( \" it\\'s a perfect engine , an eating machine \" ) make it that much more terrifying . \\nwhen vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . \\nthe entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . \\n \" jaws \" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . \\nit is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it\\'s no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by \" star wars \" ) . \\neven today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock\\'s \" psycho , \" and it never seems to age . \\nalthough grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . \\nthe technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . \\nscheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time \" jaws \" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . \\nnevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . \\nscheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what\\'s right and going against the entire town . \\n \" it\\'s your first summer here , you know , \" mayor vaughn warns him . \\ndreyfuss , who had previously been seen in \" american graffiti \" ( 1973 ) and \" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz \" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . \\nhowever , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie\\'s captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . \\nbordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . \\nhe\\'s slightly deranged , and shaw\\'s performance is almost a caricature . \\nhowever , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . \\nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . \\nindianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . \\nhis tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . \\nshaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . \\nof course , we can\\'t leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind\\'s fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . \\na shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in \" jaws , \" and they are a threat . \\nevery one of spielberg\\'s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . \\nthe shark in \" jaws \" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed \" bruce \" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . \\nmany have forgotten , but \" jaws \" was a sort of precursor to \" waterworld \" ( 1995 ) , a movie\\'s who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . \\nbut , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood . \\n',\n",

       " b' \" the end of the affair \" is a dark and moody romantic period piece , that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs . \\nalthough it\\'s slow and sometimes confusing to follow , it still manages to give audiences a moving experience . \\nbased on graham greene\\'s novel of the same name , the film mainly follows 3 characters . \\nthere\\'s maurice bendrix ( ralph fiennes ) who has an affair with henry mile\\'s ( stephen rea ) wife sarah ( julianne moore ) . \\nsarah finds henry to be a bore , because well , he\\'s just a normal guy . \\nit\\'s all work and no play with him . \\nwhile maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah , and would do anything for her . \\nunfortunately the two break up . \\nthis is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks , so that leads us to the present . \\nit\\'s a few years later , and they both still think of each other , so maurice hires a private detective ( ian hart ) to see what sarah is up too . \\nwhile this may sound straight forward it\\'s not . \\nit\\'s a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men , unhappiness , and the ever lasting love . \\nall this may sound like a drag , but it really captures your interest . \\nwith great performances by ralph fiennes ( doing another english patient type of film , only this movie is better ) and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all 5 films she did in 1999 , i believe this was the role , she had the most passion for , and you can see why . \\nthe story was also well written thanks to neil jordan . \\neven though i didn\\'t read the book , there\\'s no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive . \\nwhat\\'s so moving about it you ask ? \\nthe tragedy of it all . \\nit\\'s not the typical romance , in which a guy finds a girl , they fall in love and all is well , this is more complicated and depressing . \\nit really shows the complexity of a relationship , because nothing is ever perfect . \\neveryone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces . \\nback to neil jordan\\'s script , it wasn\\'t only red roses . \\nthere were times when i felt it too be a little slow , but most romances are . \\nit also tended to be a bit confusing , especially at the start . \\nit keep jumping around from past to present , so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things . \\nalso a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan . \\ni\\'d have to say this is his finest achievement to date , because quite frankly i\\'ve never really found his work to be up to par . \\nit just never did anything for me , until now . \\nwhen it ends , it leaves viewers a little saddened , but provoked nonetheless . \\nthis is definitely one of the best films of 99 , and had some of the best acting , most notably by moore . \\nnot for all movie goers , but for those who are film buffs and want something of value . \\n',\n",
       " b'funny how your expectations can be defeated , and not in good ways . \\nthe ghost and the darkness promised ( at least , it seemed to me to promise ) a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature . \\nwhat it delivered was mystery science theater 3000-level material -- an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters . \\n \" get new jobs ! \" \\nwas one line , if i remember correctly . \\nat the end of the 19th century , col . patterson ( val kilmer , whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr ) is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda . \\nhe is having immensely stereotypical problems : the natives are restless , his boss is a jerk , and now two man-eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off . \\npatterson tries to handle the situation himself , incompetently , and then turns to charles remington ( michael douglas ) , a hunter of world reknown ( or something like that ) . \\nthe movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions , they should have gotten top billing and co-starred with siegfried and roy . \\nthey are nigh-invulnerable , as one comic book put it , and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature . \\ngive me a break . \\nthe movie hasn\\'t got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas ; it\\'s just trying to find convenient ways to stall us . \\neven the lion hunts themselves are idiotic . \\nget this : remington\\'s big plan is to build a large scaffold-like structure in the middle of the savannah , sit on it , and wait for the lion to show up . \\nhe does this , and then gets knocked off by a bird . \\nby the end of the movie , the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand . \\nthe acting is forgettable . \\ndouglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow , but it\\'s nothing he hasn\\'t done before . \\nkilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else , somewhere else , and the rest vanish into the cinematography . \\nthe camera , by the way , sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent . \\nwhat did i expect from this movie ? \\ni dunno . \\nsome real excitement , i suppose . \\na sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation . \\nno such luck . \\ni dug out my tattered copy of hemingway\\'s \" the short happy life of francis macomber \" and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind . \\n',\n",
       " b'writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer ) \\nstarring : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechoso \\ni suppose i\\'m not extremely surprised that \" virus \" comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it\\'s an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr . cameron\\'s early works . \\nin fact , \" virus \" is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the \" aliens \" vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future . \\nno such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron\\'s wing for years and years , i\\'m beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him . \\nin fact , \" virus \" should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like \" virus \" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget . \\nthe film seems to not only borrow it\\'s plot from last year\\'s similarly-fated \" deep rising , \" but also from a clunkish b-movie from the \\'80s called \" leviathan , \" an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part \" alien , \" part john carpenter\\'s twisted remake of \" the thing . \" \\n \" virus , \" again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water . \\nthey get on . \\nthey break up into pairs and investigate . \\nand they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) . \\nnot that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters . \\nof its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper . \\nand it\\'s not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even \" aliens \" played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just don\\'t give a damn . \\ni almost don\\'t even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he\\'s a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed . \\nlike anthony hopkins for \" legends of the fall \" ( the line \" scrooooooo \\'em \" has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) . \\nor peter o\\'toole in \" caligula . \" \\ngreat actor , horrific performance . \\nit happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland\\'s career that no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film . \\nthough it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone\\'s still trying to catch up on the potential oscar-nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it\\'s laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . . . if , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them . \\n \" virus \" mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , \" if it\\'s dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable . \" \\nand if you don\\'t believe me , go back and rent \" godzilla , \" and tell me if there\\'s even one shot where we see godzilla either a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him ( well , you don\\'t really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it ) . \\nbut all of this doesn\\'t matter since \" virus \" is basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie . \\nthe action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i\\'ve ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean-extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn\\'t figure it out when i saw it ) . \\nimagine the first attack of the aliens in \" aliens , \" shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that\\'s basically the whole of \" virus \" : one horribly-directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members . \\nand my god , it\\'s a long damn sit . \\nwith no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it\\'s a wonder that it even got made . \\nwe already know that big movie studios\\' mentality is shallow at best , and movies like \" out of sight \" and \" saving private ryan \" give you more faith in them , but movies like \" virus \" manage to drain a little more out of the pool . \\ni almost wish that instead of making this movie , john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light . \\nthey read the script , they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) , and they still went ahead with the project , only to have bruno and company shit back in their face . \\neven though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie , i\\'d say even more contempt should be aimed at mr . bruno for making a movie that could be this bad . \\nin fact , shouts of \" egad , man , what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway ? \" \\nare not only justifiable , but encouraged . \\n',\n",
       " b'it\\'s been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller , where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters , but it\\'s been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually * shock * cared for the characters , not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles , flaws , and strengths to emerge so radiantly . \\ni\\'d saw that it\\'s been at least a couple decades , even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers , though i\\'m hardly comparing \" a simple plan \" to , say , \" rear window \" or \" strangers on a train . \" \\nyet it\\'s almost as good . \\nit\\'s simple , yet strangely complex , and astonishingly rewarding , because instead of moving from plot point to plot point , and merely laying out they-might-be-caught overtones , it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to , all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral . \\nelegantly directed by sam raimi ( yes , the same ) , \" a simple plan \" concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright , moderately financially stable working man ( bill paxton ) , his dim-witted brother ( billy bob thornton ) , and his drinking buddy ( brent briscoe ) . \\nwithout anyone around , and the possibility that no one would come looking for it , the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes , they will keep it , but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking , and so they generally don\\'t flaunt anything they don\\'t want to flaunt , they\\'ll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton . \\nthe possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse : a ) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities ; b ) they could try to fight off the rightful owners , who are either villainous or just ; or c ) they could fight amongst themselves . \\n \" a simple plan , \" though borrows a little from each of these . \\na little tiff with the cops here , a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent ( a chilling gary cole ) there ) , and a bit of inside feuding over here . \\nbut , as austin powers would say , that\\'s not necessarily its bag ( baby ) . \\nwhat i most admired about this film , and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it\\'s successfully able to have its cake and eat it too . \\nit effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches , like the ones mentioned above , but at the same time , it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag . \\nso while steps are taken to neatly cover things up , and these subsequent steps go miserably awry , the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to , they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity . \\nin one early scene , paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn\\'t look like it was all stolen ( not a bad idea ) , when thornton screws up ( as he does continuously throughout the movie ) , and paxton has to do some major covering-up ( read : homicide ) . \\ninstead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands-washing , raimi shows a lengthy , painful shot from a low-angle onto paxton\\'s face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion . \\nthere\\'s a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he\\'s committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective , but the previous shot is even better : more morally complex and more gut-wrenching . \\nin short , probably the best piece of direction raimi\\'s ever done , demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results ( for further proof , watch \" persona \" \\'s \" sex scene \" and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman\\'s ever done ) . \\nbut the film hardly stops here ; it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof . \\nyet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story . \\nwhen the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical ( with aid from his pregnant wife , played by bridget fonda , a pal to raimi ) , he does , and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights . \\nthere\\'s at least two grand shootouts , and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history , and when they arrive , they don\\'t come with masochistic delight but with cringe-inducing horror . \\nduring the one , i was actually sinking into my chair , with the mantra \" they can\\'t do this , can they ? \" \\nstreeming through my head . \\nin fact , this film , which is getting many comparisons to the coen\\'s [superior , but forget about it] \" fargo , \" has many similar moments of manic insanity , attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what , in other hands , would be over-the-top distractedness ( imagine , i suppose , robert rodriguez directing this . . . then \\nagain , after seeing the \" evil dead \" films , i\\'d hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off , although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed \" raimi \" moments , a rifle-shot notwithstanding ) . \\ninstead , raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch , easily letting the story and characters co-exist , while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out , like some offbeat comic touches . \\nmost particularly , billy bob thornton\\'s character , jacob , is a brilliant creation . \\nhis dim-wittedness is often hilarious ( for most of the film , every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter ) , but there\\'s authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we\\'re not totally laughing at him . \\nthe chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full-condescension because thornton is so damn real . \\njacob\\'s a multi-dimensional character , and while being stupid , we see that as not so much a flaw , but a strength to his character : his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system , primarily towards the middle where his bud and co-conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money . \\nthe final third of the film spends much time with him , and many of the touches upon his character , not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b . smith ( adapting his own book , by the way ) are just great . \\ni particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend , told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near-sweetness and further strength of his saddened character . \\nthornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance , by far the best performance he\\'s ever given and further proof that he\\'s the best character actor in contemporary cinema ( if you don\\'t believe me , go back and watch his wonderful performance in \" primary colors , \" a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn\\'t been in the same year ) because he\\'s easily able to slip into a character , and make him completely and utterly believable . \\nhe brings so much weight to the film that , as it is with most character actors , it\\'s difficult picturing anyone else in the role . \\nthe rest of the cast is great too , from paxton\\'s declining working man to chelcie ross\\' amiable town sheriff . \\neven fonda shows off her talents nicely . \\nand if i had any complaints about the film , it\\'s that the plot is almost too simplistic , and that at times , it seems too much like an exercise , like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved . \\nand the occasional narration is , as it usually is , annoying ( narration should be used with extreme caution , especially when you\\'re trying to set things up and/or express emotions - didn\\'t raimi watch the first murder scene ? ) . \\nand , the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie , the ending is basically amiss . \\ni won\\'t reveal it , but it\\'s way too cruel and too much of an outsider set-up , as if the appearance of a plane wasn\\'t already too much of that anyway . \\nfor a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved , this is the wrong ending . \\nimagine a character-controlled ending ; otherwise , it\\'s like if in \" crime and punishment \" if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing . . . not that i\\'m at all comparing \" a simple plan \" to dostoevsky . \\nthe ending does work , despite my protestations , but to me , there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it ; but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it , then just ignore me and go about your day . \\nbut despite my mere claims , make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout , and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured , not because of any kind of gore factor ( which is , thankfully for this , very minimal ) , but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that i\\'ve frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile . \\nat least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece . \\n',\n",
       " b'most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts . \\nmy family , for the most part , hates him and his movies . \\ni think he\\'s very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years . \\nso maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of . \\nunrestrained by physical boundaries , allen\\'s humor comes shining through . \\nthose who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen\\'s intelligent observations of life . \\nthose who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one . \\nin 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they\\'d never seen before . \\ntoy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present . \\nmany critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture . \\nantz , however , has upped the ante considerably . \\ndisney\\'s a bug\\'s life isn\\'t due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal . \\nby beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience\\'s thirst for computer-animated films . \\nbut don\\'t let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared . \\nin the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios . \\nin 1997 , it was the volcano duel . \\nin my opinion , dante\\'s peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality . \\nvolcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations . \\nin 1998 , there are twice as many competing films . \\nfirst was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it\\'s cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact . \\nbut now , it\\'s even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks ) . \\nwho will prevail ? \\ntime will tell , but i\\'m sure that mr . mouse has nothing to fear . \\nthis may sound like i didn\\'t like antz ; on the contrary , i\\'d put it up there with toy story . \\nbut due to it\\'s pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn\\'t appear in disney\\'s version . \\nsome of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film . \\nsexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks\\' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd . \\nthe humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended . \\nthis is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents . \\nantz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen\\'s shtick and franz kafka\\'s metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug . \\nz ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker . \\n \" when you\\'re the middle child in a family of five million . . . \" he comments about his neglected childhood . \\none night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life . \\nin walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown . \\nbala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader . \\nafter discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there\\'s a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony . \\nin order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants . \\nbut to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her . \\nhe and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed . \\nthe queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony . \\nmeanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him . \\nso z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites . \\nthe battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence . \\nhowever , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence . \\nthe second half of the film revolves around z\\'s kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia . \\nthere , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants . \\nthe adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass . \\nlooming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i\\'m just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally ) . \\nthe ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground . \\nvisually , it\\'s an exciting rush of adrenaline . \\nbut don\\'t be fooled . . . \\nlittle kids shouldn\\'t see this , as they may just try and copy it . \\nafter seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again . \\nhopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel . \\nas an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date . \\nvisually , it\\'s as stunning as what dreams may come . \\nthe best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren\\'t limited by gravity . \\nthey can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible . \\none great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball . \\nthe animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball . \\nhowever , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy\\'s shoe . \\nit\\'s truly a great example of film making at its finest . \\nwith computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants\\' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices . \\nthe best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover ) . \\nat one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores . . . \\ndo they ? ) . \\nbarbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body . \\nyoung kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course ) . \\ndisney\\'s a bug\\'s life looks good , but i don\\'t know if they will be able to best dreamworks\\' newest animated feature in terms of animation . \\nif not , then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do : go head to head with the big mouse , and knock him down ( yes , anastasia was good , but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney ) . \\nvocal talent is always essential to an animated feature , and antz has one of the best line-ups seen since toy story . \\nin fact , it far exceeds that one . \\nwoody allen has always been funny , but here he transcends most of what he\\'s done in the past few years . \\nwithout a body , his comic timing is the most noticeable thing . \\nin fact , i\\'m pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines . \\nsharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability , though for the most part , stone works best as a dramatic actress . \\nsylvester stallone ( teamed up with stone once again ) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor , not a typecast action star . \\nafter a snub at the oscars last year , stallone is proving himself as the serious ( or comedic , as illustrated here ) actor that he is . \\ngene hackman is superb as the gruff-talking general , almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona . \\nchristopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice , and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns . \\nanne bancroft has a minimal role , but she\\'s effective nonetheless . \\ndanny glover has a small role , but he does a very , very good job . \\ndan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick , euro-trash bees--both are very unrecognizable , especially aykroyd . \\njennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver , although most people won\\'t recognize her voice either . \\nmany people will recognize grant shaud\\'s voice as the foreman . \\nhe played miles on the tv show murphy brown . \\nthis is definitely a huge cast with some high-profile names , and it will definitely help it\\'s grosses . \\nof course , you can probably tell where a lot of the $60 million budget went to , also . \\ndirectors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers ( though guterman did direct a 1994 feature , headless ! ) . \\nbut both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture . \\ntense at times , and very funny throughout , the two hold this film together like professionals . \\nthe screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot , but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults . \\nkids will delight in the animation , while parents can laugh heartily at the humor . \\nmost of it will go over young children\\'s heads . \\ndoes that mean you shouldn\\'t take kids to see it ? \\nnot at all . \\nthey will have a lot of fun watching this one . \\nwhat is great is the themes that are given to us . \\npart social commentary , part romance story , and part moral drama , antz gives everyone something to talk about , whether it be the animation , or the discussions of individualism and community . \\nthankfully , it\\'s not subtle in either aspects . \\nantz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action . \\nsometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie , but the violence is what should keep kids at home . \\nthe battle scene has ants melting in acid , and bugs being speared to death . \\nand the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight . \\nbut other than that ( and some sexual innuendos ) , it\\'s a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters . \\ni doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough , but it\\'s still advisable to leave really young children at home . \\nhave i confused you enough ? \\nif you do take your kids , i recommend seeing the film with them , because more than likely , you\\'ll enjoy it the most . \\n',\n",
       " b'jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today . \\nfrom time-to-time , she blows away audiences with powerful , intense performances . \\non the other hand , this is the same woman who made her jaw-droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis\\' king kong . \\nand , much as lange would probably prefer movie-goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume , every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it , if only in quality . \\nhush is one such example . \\nlange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn\\'t such a prime example of motion picture tedium . \\nthe film opens , as many so-called \" psychological thrillers \" do , by posing as a light drama . \\nwe are introduced to jackson ( johnathon schaech , last encounter in tom hanks\\' that thing you do ! ) and helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love . \\njackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother , martha ( lange ) . \\nthe moment i first saw martha , i started looking for fangs . \\nsoon , the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant ( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm ) . \\nonce that goal is accomplished , she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives . \\nas long as she gets her way , martha is a perfectly amicable person , but when helen defies her , it\\'s a declaration of war . \\nhush has three very simple problems : it\\'s incredibly dumb , it\\'s incredibly boring , and it\\'s incredibly predictable ( at least up to the stupefying ending ) . \\nthis film has absolutely nothing to recommend it , with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow-covered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow\\'s bare buttocks . \\nfrankly , it\\'s embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange\\'s stature give a performance like this -- it\\'s like a bad blanche dubois ( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire ) . \\nmeanwhile , paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines , and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object . \\nas in all psychological thrillers , the battle lines are clearly drawn . \\nhere , it\\'s mom and against wife , with jackson caught in the middle . \\nof course , since schaech\\'s character is poorly-developed and badly acted , it\\'s impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation . \\nmaybe someone should ask him if he\\'s familiar with oedipus . \\nmartha is , of course , the evil one . \\nhow do we know she\\'s evil ? \\nshe smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor -- two sure signs that the devil is at work . \\non the other hand , helen is a good girl . \\nthe evidence for this is that she\\'s nice to old ladies and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents . \\nthat\\'s about it for character development . \\nbeyond that point , hush is just a series of increasingly hard-to-swallow coincidences , contrivances , and moronic plot twists . \\nhowever , the first 85 minutes are just a warm-up for the ending , which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying . \\ni can\\'t imagine anyone , no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole , liking this conclusion . \\neither there was some serious last-minute editing or someone left out a few pages of the script . \\nbefore the climax , i disliked hush ; by the time the end credits started , i hated it . \\nviewers invest something in every movie they watch , no matter how good or bad it is . \\ncheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable . \\nmost entries into this worn-out , worm-eaten genre aren\\'t especially good . \\nfilms like consenting adults , the hand that rocks the cradle , and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along . \\nin general , however , they\\'re directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension . \\nthat\\'s not the case with really bad thrillers like this , which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation -- the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care . \\nindeed , the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid . \\n',\n",
       " b'm : i-2 , the sequel to mission impossible , is a james bond wannabe film , but it fails to even come close to that film in wit , humor , and entertainment value . \\nit tries to be a spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film just looks like it\\'s an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses . \\nit is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human . \\nthe coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols . \\nthe film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence . \\nexcept for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed . \\nas for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen . \\nm : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue . \\nthe film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point . \\nthe only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film\\'s supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way . \\nit\\'s a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series . \\nbut its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance . \\njohn woo ( \" broken arrow \" / \" face/off \" ) is good at doing car chases , choreographed fights with midair flips and kung-fu kicks , slo-mo shots of two guns blazing , and of fire explosions , but he just can\\'t seem to handle dialogue and suspense . \\nthe star of the film and co-producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast . \\ncruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one . \\ntheir romance didn\\'t work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn\\'t convincing . \\nthe film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success . \\nwe will be in three different locations instantaneously : sydney , the american southwest , and seville . \\nfirst , we are in sydney , australia , where a scientist with a muffled russian accent , dr . nekhorvich ( rade ) , mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it . \\nhe also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain . \\nwhich explains the film\\'s mythic theme . . . as \\nwe enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil . \\nthe one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one-dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role . \\nat least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense . \\nsoon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri , but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains . \\nbefore they crash the plane and parachute out of it , the one who was posing as dimitri , turns out to be sean ambrose ( scott ) , a rogue member of the imf , which is a cia-like clone . \\nhe steals the package with the antidote , peels off a latex mask , which is a replica of the hero of the story , ethan hunt ( cruise ) , who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust . \\nsean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices . \\nwe already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel . \\nwoo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides , so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain . \\nit makes it seem as if anyone could be another character , which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense . \\nnext we are in a mountain range in the american southwest , and ethan is on vacation , hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool , when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard , delivers via a rocket launcher , a pair of talking sunglasses . \\nhunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help , billy baird ( john polson ) and luther stickell ( ving rhames ) , with luther running a high-gadget computer , but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall ( thandie ) to join his team . \\nhe is told , as an incentive to recruit her , all her criminal charges will be dropped . \\nhopkins then signs off with the tag line : this message will self-destruct in five seconds . \\nactually , with the departure of hopkins , it was this disposable film that actually self-destructed at this point . \\nin seville , hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase , where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road . \\nhe also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal , and learns that she is valuable because her ex-boyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f * ck her . \\nthe imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f * ck him , as she leads them to his hide-out in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort , the south african , hugh stamp ( richard roxburgh ) . \\nrobert towne , the screenwriter , who contributed to the first \" mission , \" who is noted for doing \" chinatown \" -- writes a colorless , pedestrian script , one that fails even to be funny in a camp way . \\nthe terrorists , who aim to rule the world , are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options , as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote , insuring that they will make billions on the stock . \\nethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah , with his only conflict being who is more important to save first . \\nethan does this rescue against all odds , as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company , fight it out with sean and the other terrorists , and rescue nyah , who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean\\'s getting it , as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle . \\nethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle , using kick-boxing , winning a shootout , throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists , making some more use out of that peeling mask bit , and by being completely fearless and larger than life , while he kick\\'s everyone\\'s ass . \\nif i was only entertained by this . . .

( hank azaria ) -- finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual attraction . \\nbut she\\'s not the only ghost from finn\\'s past that\\'s going to be paying him a visit . \\ncomparisons with the afore-mentioned \" romeo + juliet \" seem inevitable since these films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic drama into a current setting . \\n \" great expectations \" is a much better venture , though , because it treats its source with even-handed respect , where \" romeo \" was never quite sure whether to be a spoof , a homage or both . \\nthe movie is a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezki\\'s sexy cinematography ; notably , he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with a luscious , erotic charge that\\'s steamier than the film\\'s ( surprisingly muted ) love scenes . \\nthe eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the on-screen action beautifully , especially new songs by tori amos , mono and duncan sheik . \\nacting credits are first-rate , often hiding the screenplay\\'s occasional slip-ups . \\nhawke is sincere and solid as a leading man ( something we also learned from \" gattaca \" ) , and his finn is quite a likeable guy . \\npaltrow\\'s estella , on the other hand , is rather underdeveloped . \\nwhile the actress is at her icily seductive best , we\\'re not told very much about her character , and as a result , it\\'s often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond a physical level ( but , oh , * what * a physical level ) ; sometimes , we root for finn although we don\\'t quite understand why she\\'s fueling his fire . \\nrobert de niro is nice and sophisticated in the benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play ; on the other end of the acting spectrum is bancroft , a macabre , throaty delight who mambos and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that would make norma desmond jealous . \\nalfonso cuaron\\'s visually elegant direction helps to distract from the dry moments that pop up more frequently around the movie\\'s climax . \\nanother problem is predictability ; you can guess your way through the plot even if you aren\\'t familiar with the story . \\ndespite its script flaws , though , \" great expectations \" is undeniably romantic without being corny or gloppy . \\nand frankly , it\\'s nice to see a film that embraces softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality . \\nperhaps that renovated release date , awfully close to valentine\\'s day , will end up helping \" great expectations \" \\' seemingly average box office chances after all . \\n',\n",

       " b'the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year . \\nwe are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics , loved by the people , and make tons of money at the box office . \\nthis year , the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic , the mummy . \\ni have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies , and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them . \\nthat tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza . \\nin the mummy , the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o\\'connell . \\nhe teams up with a curious , clumsy librarian named evelyn , played by rachel weisz , to find the mysterious city of the dead , hamunaptra . \\nevelyn loves egypt , and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable . \\nrick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle , and that\\'s why she chose him to lead her there . \\nalso tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn\\'s brother , jonathan , played by john hannah ( sliding doors ) . \\nnow in hamunaptra , the three uncover \" the book of the dead . \" \\nthe curious evelyn unlocks the book , reads from it , and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep ( arnold vosloo ) becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book . \\nalong with imhotep arising from the dead , the ten curses of egypt become in full effect , launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra . \\nnot only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him , he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt . \\ndon\\'t expect huge things out of the mummy , but just expect to have a good time . \\nthis movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects , which may turn off some viewers . \\non the other hand , this type of film is one of my favorites , but that\\'s up to you to decide . \\nthere is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though . \\nthe state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world . \\nwe are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert , swarms of beetles and locusts , and even creatures crawling under a human\\'s skin . \\nthese may have been in other movies before , but not like in the mummy . \\nas of now , the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year , but all this could change when star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country . \\nin the past , brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles . \\nwhen playing \" george \" in disney\\'s george of the jungle , he was mainly not known by anyone . \\ni would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name , and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens . \\nin the mummy , fraser gets to play an action hero , and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role , as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle . \\nalthough brendan fraser is great , rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast . \\nweisz really reminded me of a character from an old , horror film . \\nthe way she acts , looked , and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time . \\nevelyn is probably the only character that was likable , considering that the other characters , like john hannah\\'s , didn\\'t get much personal attention . \\nin many films , when different genres are mixed , the mixing usually works , and i like it for the most part . \\nin the mummy though , not all of the mixing works . \\nthere are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror , some with potential comedy , some with potential drama , and some with potential pure action , but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work . \\nthe mummy could have gotten an \" a \" rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these . \\ni didn\\'t mind the corny one-liners here and there during action sequences , but it certainly could have done without them . \\nthe cinematography is amazing in the mummy . \\nparticularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt , we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt , mummies , and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians . \\nthe costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography . \\nfrom ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits , the costumes are always top notch . \\nthe bottom line- with the mummy , the summer is off to its usually great start . \\n',\n",

       " b'one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often-acclaimed director sidney lumet\\'s \" gloria , \" a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film , had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre . \\nsuddenly , i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before , i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in . \\nwhen a movie is over , aren\\'t we supposed to think about it for a while , and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with ? \\ni thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and #2 , even if i had been with someone there wouldn\\'t have been anything to talk about in the first place . \\nto be sure , \" gloria \" begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven-year-old boy\\'s family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it . \\nright before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with . \\neventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean-luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment . \\nmeanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn\\'t commit and returns to her ex-boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime . \\nwhen he refuses to give it to her , and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky , she leaves with him in order to save his life , but not before holding the men at gunpoint , stealing all of their money , and forcing them to strip nude . \\ngloria is the type of fast-talking , smart-mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( don\\'t they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with . \\nthe previous incarnation of \" gloria \" by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands , remains unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even though i can\\'t really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one , regardless of the director or stars . \\nthere is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original , but the film itself is simply lifeless , with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn\\'t completely unbearable to watch . \\ni liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again . \\nthese bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by-the-numbers . \\nthroughout , my mind was repeatedly asking the question , \" who really cares ? \" \\nas gloria , sharon stone has adopted an over-the-top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn\\'t sound realistic at all . \\nin the beginning , in fact , i was amazed at how amateurish stone\\'s performance was , but as the film progressed she got better . \\nalthough not one of her better turns , stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored . \\njean-luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag . \\nall other actors who appeared were considerably wasted , none more than cathy moriarty , an entertaining actress in her own right , who is billed fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria\\'s friend whom she turns to for help . \\nsony , the studio that released \" gloria , \" obviously does not have any faith in the film , and i don\\'t blame them . \\nthey declined to screen the picture for critics , which is never a good sign , particularly with the high-profile people involved . \\nalthough how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is ( just look at the spectacular \" in dreams , \" which failed to even make the top 10 last week ) , i have a suspicion \" gloria \" is going to vanish from theaters faster than \" ishtar , \" judging from the opening night 7 : 00 p . m . showing i saw it at , where there were about ten to fifteen people present , counting myself . \\nalthough stone can be an impressive actress ( just watch her in 1995\\'s \" casino \" or 1996\\'s \" last dance \" if you don\\'t believe me ) and sidney lumet can be a respectable director , there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of \" gloria \" was worth remaking or , for that matter , why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful . \\n',\n",

       " b\"one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel . \\nthat concept , although many purists doubt its scientific credentials , spawned many interesting novels , comic books and films in the last century . \\nhowever , the big grand-daddy of time travels , h . g . wells' novel the time machine , wasn't written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences . \\nthe author , h . g . wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich , idle capitalist class and impoverished labour . \\nwhatever intentions wells had , the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages . \\ninstead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space . \\nthe novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration . \\nfirst of them was george pal , who in 1960 directed film which would , through the years , become genre classic of its own . \\nthe plot revolves about george ( rod taylor ) , victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension - time . \\nat the eve of the new 20th century , george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention - machine that would enable him to travel through time . \\nthey are skeptical , but that doesn't prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future . \\nat first , he travels slowly , seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars . \\nfinally , after witnessing world war three , he travels far into the future , hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions . \\nwhen he finally reaches year 802 , 701 ad , at first glance , new world looks like utopia - humanity consists of young , beautiful , but idle eloi , people who are fed , clothed and taken care of by unseen machines . \\nbut , weena ( yvette mimieux ) , eloi woman , tells george about another side of the coin - in the night , her people is preyed upon by morlocs , humanoid creatures from the underworld . \\nthe time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature - the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times . \\nfor h . g . wells it was frightening threat of class struggle ; for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan , who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war , it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust , underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie . \\neven the modern audience , which would be tempted to discard the film as old-fashioned , could find some values in its universal messages , fit for each era . \\ncompared with the genre films of today , the time machine is even better , and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent , thought-provoking films . \\nof course , since this is hollywood product after all , the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure , sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness . \\nfor example , it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future ; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters , while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today . \\nsome of the final scenes , that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero , are also rather unconvincing . \\nbut , on the other hand , the film is very well directed , cleverly paced and the special effects , although definitely old-fashioned , are more than adequate for this kind of picture . \\nthe acting is good , with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles , while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george's trusted friend filby . \\nyvette mimieux , who plays weena , on the other hand , would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role . \\nhowever , despite all those flaws , the time machine is a very good piece of cinema , something that connoisseurs of quality science-fiction films sorely miss these days . \\n\",\n",

       " b'perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects . \\nthere is no question that action-adventure and science-fiction/action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise . \\nwhereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion-dollar creations of computer technology . \\nthe latest in this visually awesome series of movies , the wachowski brothers\\' the matrix , is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie\\'s story . \\nunlike many sci-fi movies which promote themselves as effects-heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise , the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event . \\nit runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose , and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film\\'s length . \\ncontrary to popular trend , the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound . \\nin this regard , the movie is something like a card sharp . \\nwith its flashy mass stripped away , the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented . \\nthe script is characteristically weak , and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach . \\nbut , like the card sharp , the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent . \\nthe viewers don\\'t care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner . \\nand right around the corner they usually are , for the script tells a fast-paced , albeit frequently revisited story . \\nas the movie explains , the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind . \\nbillions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence -- the matrix -- \" farms \" our life energy . \\nonly a select group of individuals knows of the \" real \" world , and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra-cool morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . \\nmorpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) , believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth . \\nthe cast plays out this story in stylish fashion . \\nthe set design is very dynamic , running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy . \\nthe costumes , as well as the actors who wear them , add to the roles . \\nfor instance , the manifested antagonists in the movie , a group of \" agents \" created by the matrix in its computer program , all dress in matching secret servicewear ; the rebel fighters , on the other hand , dress in rich hues of leather . \\nthe casting cannot be criticized , for the typically stoic reeves isn\\'t required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool . \\nsupports in carrie-anne moss , joe pantoliano , and hugo weaving are all effectual . \\none of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year\\'s science fiction masterpiece dark city , particularly if one ponders how this same premise would\\'ve worked from a different approach . \\nthe alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective , requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear ; here , the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill-ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise . \\nthe better picture between the two depends on the viewer , but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun . \\n',\n",

a place of blooming blossoms , green forests and clear waters ; a place really worth sacrificing your life for . \\nbecause of its lack of three dimensionality , the film looses most of its possibilities , but stays afloat because of some interesting scenes , amusing performances ( especially by willem dafoe ) and one interesting and important thought , depicted in many different ways throughout the movie . \\nduring the film , the audience is as confused as the characters : detached from their everyday existence and no longer able to see the difference between the real world and the alternative reality that they have created . \\n \" the matrix \" , despite of its many dark and disturbing thoughts , ends with a light at the end of the tunnel . \\n \" existenz \" does not . \\nit is a one time experience , ending in blood , gore and madness - a rather frightening forecast for tomorrow . \\n',\n",

       " b\"while watching boiler room , i was constantly reminded of last year's masterpiece fight club . \\nboth films consist of a predominately male cast . \\nboth films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires . \\nand both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator , who eventually realizes that these men have to be stopped . \\nwhile boiler room writer/director ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club , he does contribute another impressive work to a series of films aiming to represent the new generation . \\na generation which has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants to be a millionaire . \\npaying homage to oliver stone's 1987 classic wall street , younger is almost modernizing the tale by using younger , hipper actors to play the greedy villains as opposed to the older , more experienced types . \\nas is true in real life , younger minds are becoming richer and richer from their knowledge of more standard technology . \\nboiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages . \\nanother similarity with fight club is that both films are not action flicks . \\nsome people are convinced that an all-male cast automatically means there must be gory violence , here is proof that this is not true . \\nif you want to see an action movie starring ben affleck , go see reindeer games this weekend . \\nif you want to see a smart , insightful film with excellent acting and a clever script , see boiler room . \\ngiovanni ribisi gives an outstanding performance as the film's narrator , seth . \\nafter dropping out of college and running a lucrative gambling center for college students in his apartment , seth is offered a high paying job by a wealthy man ( nicky katt ) . \\nhe agrees to take the job ( in which you are guaranteed to become a millionaire within three years ) of selling stock to well-off americans from the mid-west over the telephone and begins to fit in quite well with his co-workers . \\nlearning tricky techniques to deceive innocent people into buying shares of a good in production , seth figures this is too good to be true . \\nafter stumbling into a room at the wrong time , he knows there is something no good about this company . \\nat this point , seth is left with the ultimate choice ; continue with the american dream and make millions or tell the authorities that something fishy is going on . \\nribisi is believable as seth especially when he shares scenes with ron rifkin , playing seth's dad . \\nthe two have perfect chemistry as a troubled father and son trying to impress each other and simultaneously impress themselves . \\nthe transitions from anger to sympathy that these scenes contain are the standout segments of the entire film . \\nthe supporting cast of greedy co-workers is also flawless . \\nben affleck shines in a short but sweet performance as a recruiter for the company , nicky katt is fabulous as the ostensibly friendly boss who eventually becomes extremely jealous of seth , and vin diesel gives his best performance of his career as the foil character of nicky katt . \\nthe energy of the cast as a whole makes boiler room well paced and never boring . \\nthe only major error in the film is that nothing major happens . \\nthere is no big plot twist or climatic point to make the film more memorable . \\ndue to the lack of a major event , boiler room never finds a suitable genre to fit into . \\nthe movie is not intense enough to be a thriller , the romantic segments involving seth and abby ( nia long ) are not properly finalized , and the dialogue isn't funny enough to make it a comedy . \\nin having trouble to characterize the movie as a whole , boiler room is slightly confused at times . \\nit doesn't seem to know which category to fit itself into . \\none satisfying concluding scene could have changed the whole film for the better . \\notherwise , the movie is fun to watch thanks to its lively cast of young actors . \\n\",\n",
       " b'one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made , \" se7en \" is just a few steps away from brilliance . \\nhowever , those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss . \\nthe film received mixed reviews upon release , but there\\'s an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice . \\nat times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing , but the script and the ultimate pay-off are excellent . \\nthe shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable . \\nthis piece of work is 100% intensity . \\nit\\'s uncomfortable to watch , yet compelling . \\n \" i want not to look , yet i cannot turn away . \" \\nthe story creeps along slowly and deliberately , crafted by visionary director david fincher . \\nhe has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions , but not giving away too much too soon . \\nthis is the guy who directed the ominous \" alien 3 \" . \\n \" se7en \" is even more ominous because the threat is real . \\nit\\'s human and , while the script takes some artistic licence , the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic . \\nthat is , if a human being could be so intelligent , patient , wealthy , and disillusioned . \\nafter the most bizarre opening credits i\\'ve ever seen ( refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment ) , the initial character development takes place . \\nmorgan freeman stars as detective william somerset , a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society . \\nbrad pitt co-stars as detective david mills , the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys . \\nthese two fine actors give the film its human qualities ( along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow , who plays tracy , mills\\' wife ) . \\nhowever , none of them stands out above the material . \\nno disrespect intended , but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same . \\nan ironic note is that somerset has only a week ( or 7 , that\\'s seven , days ) left on the force to train his young protege . \\nthe title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins , as chronicled by john milton in \" paradise lost \" --gluttony , greed , sloth , lust , pride , envy , & wrath . \\nincidentally , i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found . \\nit\\'s the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking , but i won\\'t give that away . \\nas i said , this has a great ending and no one should spoil it . \\nanyway , the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the \" sinners \" suffer for it . \\nthe two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man . \\nthey learn that he was murdered--forced to eat himself to death . \\nthe killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and , of course , somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way . \\nif they didn\\'t , it would be one short movie !

       " b'if you\\'re going to make a two-hour hollywood in-joke , why bother releasing it to the general public ? \\nif you\\'re going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big-name actors and people who know woody allen , then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters ? \\nwhile watching celebrity , i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people . \\nwhat he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self-deprecation . \\ncelebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself , living in a world that he\\'s familiar with , dealing with people like the ones he actually knows . \\nallen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture , in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more . \\nbranagh plays lee simon , a journalist-turned-screenwriter who divorces his wife , robin ( judy davis ) , shacks up with some hot women ( famke janssen , charlize theron , winona ryder ) , and goes about trying to get big stars ( melanie griffith , leonardo dicaprio ) to read his script about an armored car robbery . \\nthe usual elements of recent allen films are all here , including the sexual insecurity of the main character , lots of self-loathing women , and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another . \\nunless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally , it\\'s not likely that you\\'ll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity . \\naside from all the in-jokes , the story falls far short of compelling , and the characters are all empty and lifeless . \\nbranagh proves once again that he\\'s a superb performer , nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly . \\nthe problem is that he\\'s the same character allen always plays , a character who\\'s getting more than a little dull to watch . \\ni mean , come on , how many times have you seen this guy ? \\n-- he hates his work , and he can\\'t be satisfied by any one woman , and , at the end of the movie , nothing has been solved . \\nhe brings all of his problems upon himself ( crashing his car because he\\'s receiving fellatio , and other such stunts ) , so it\\'s pretty hard to care about him . \\nin addition , isn\\'t allen capable of creating characters who aren\\'t just like him ? \\ni know he is , but he didn\\'t do it in celebrity . \\nthe vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances . \\ndavis , playing the same woman with low self-esteem that she played in deconstructing harry , has a few touching moments , but ends up the same despicable celebrity-type that fills the rest of the movie . \\nsome of the actresses are saved because of their beauty -- theron and ryder , especially -- but they\\'re not likable people . \\nonly famke janssen , as a book editor interested in simon\\'s new novel , has any life . \\nthe men in the picture don\\'t do much better -- joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin , while dicaprio , as a christian slater/johnny depp-type spoiled young actor , is funny but disengaging . \\nwhat\\'s really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its \" themes \" are . \\nallen seems to think that he\\'s making an insightful movie about the way \" normal \" people look at celebrities . \\nthe main problem with this is that the character with whom we\\'re supposed to identify , simon , is not a \" normal \" guy -- he\\'s just as entrenched in the hollywood image as the rest of the characters . \\nthe other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us -- none of them register as realistic , interesting characters ; they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue . \\nin addition , allen decides he needs a scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly ( robin , in this scene , says something like , \" it\\'s interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate ! \" ) . \\ncelebrity is arguably allen\\'s biggest misfire to date . \\nit does have a few good scenes -- theron\\'s super-orgasmic model character is kind of funny , and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or two . \\nbut celebrity is a failure at the core , unless allen\\'s point was to make a self-indulgent movie about himself and his friends . \\nif he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of a big joke , then he succeeded in that . \\ni , for one , don\\'t enjoy feeling like an outsider . \\n',\n",

       " b'in my review of \" the spy who shagged me , \" i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics : every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series , it is followed by a third movie that is a bore . \\nthe cause is probably complacency ; a studio sighs with relief when part 2 lives up to expectations and figures part 3 is a sure thing . \\n \" scream 3 \" provides the latest proof of this rule . \\nin los angeles production has begun on \" stab 3 : return to woodsboro , \" the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) . \\nhowever , life soon starts imitating art , and \" stab \" cast members turn up stabbed . \\nsmelling yet another book deal , gale weathers ( courteney cox arquette ) comes to the set to investigate and finds her ex-boyfriend dewey riley ( david arquette ) acting as a technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer ( parker posey ) , the actress playing gale in \" stab 3 . \" elsewhere , our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name . \\n . \\n . \\nuntil she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice . \\nthe late randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) makes a surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of a trilogy . \\nhe notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend with . \\nindeed , \" scream 3 \" tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all , the murder of sidney\\'s mother maureen before the beginning of the original \" scream . \" \\nat the scene of each murder in \" scream 3 , \" the killer leaves a photo of sidney\\'s mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood and even includes a note claiming to be her real killer . \\nto find out who the killer is , our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureen\\'s missing years when she was a starlet appearing in low-budget horror films . \\n ( even with that little information , you can probably already guess what the killer\\'s relationship to sidney is ) . \\nunlike its predecessors , \" scream 3 \" doesn\\'t have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer . \\nthe characters we do suspect are all undeveloped , so that by the end we don\\'t even care who the killer is . \\nthe jaded detective ( patrick dempsey ) ? \\nthe kinky producer ( lance henriksen ) ? \\nthe driven young director ( scott foley ) ? \\nthe ingenue ( emily mortimer ) ? \\nthe character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random . \\nwes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one a secret , so it\\'s quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen . \\nthe series\\' trademark references to other horror films have become trite and obvious . \\npossibly it\\'s the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson , who penned the first two , or maybe it\\'s that the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a cliche . \\ni groaned as an attack on sidney from the first \" scream \" was repeated moment-for-moment in the hollywood set of her home . \\nat some point , referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas . \\n \" scream 3 \" also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos and familiar faces in small roles . \\nlook for jenny mccarthy , carrie fisher , patrick warburton ( puddy from \" seinfeld \" ) , roger corman , and jason mewes and kevin smith ( as jay and silent bob ) to walk through at some point . \\nall these bit players put forth more effort than the series\\' returning stars , who are probably saving their energy for the long post- \" scream \" job search . \\nanother prediction i made in a previous review has come to pass : more movies are copying \" the blair witch project \" \\'s web strategy . \\n \" scream 3 \" has three official websites that ( wink , wink ) pretend that the events of the movie are real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie . \\nthe sunrise studios site ( scream3 . com ) has trailers for other sunrise releases as well as the \" latest \\'stab 3\\' news . \" \\nthere\\'s also a gail weathers official site ( galeweathers . com ) and a sunrise sucks site that has more \" stab \" scandals the studio wants to cover up ( sunrisesucks . com ) . \\ncraven and company promise that this is the last installment in the \" scream \" series . \\nwhile i hope that\\'s true , i don\\'t hold out much hope-horror movie series are even harder to kill than their monsters . \\nthere\\'s a \" halloween h2k \" in the works , even though michael myers was beheaded in \" h20 , \" and a \" freddy vs . jason \" has been talked about for awhile , despite the fact that both characters were \" killed off . \" \\nthere\\'s bound to be a \" scream 4 \" someday , even if it starts over with a new set of movie-star wannabes . \\nbottom line : they should have called this one \" yawn . \" \\n',\n",

       " b' \" desperate measures \" was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released : summer \\'97 . \\nfor some reason , it was delayed until hollywood\\'s traditional dumping ground : january . \\nnow that it\\'s out , i see no real reason for that delay , as it\\'s a simple yet highly entertaining film . \\nmichael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who\\'s bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of a san francisco police detective ( garcia ) . \\nkeaton agrees to the transplant , only so he can attempt escape . \\nhe succeeds , in a plan that of course could only work in the movies . \\nthe police force is now trying to kill keaton , while garcia is working against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son . \\nthe film definately has it\\'s flaws . \\nthe plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare , but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that status . \\nalso , after keaton\\'s escape , garcia\\'s captain barks at him \" how many men have to die to save your kid\\'s life ? \" \\nwhich the film treats as such an evil and insignificant remark . \\nthe thing is , it\\'s a vaild point . \\nhow many people have to be needlessly crippled , burned , and killed just to save this one child ? \\nwhat\\'s the greater good here ? \\nmany lives or one life ? \\nif movies really had guts nowadays , i would have loved to have seen this movie come down to a final choice for garcia\\'s character . \\nplace him in a situation where he knows that he has to kill keaton because keaton is about to kill someone else . \\nalas , movies these days generally have no such ambition to pull the audience\\'s strings in ways which might make the uncomfortable . \\ndespite a few silly moments ( and one or two really stupid ones ) , the good things about \" desperate measures \" outnumber the bad . \\nthe main highlight would be keaton\\'s performance . \\nthe character could have easily been an overacting , scene chewing freak , but keaton underplays it nicely . \\nhe\\'s not as menacing as he was in \" pacific heights \" or even as menacing as he was in \" batman \" ( yes kids , batman used to be a dark character ) , but you certainly get the idea that he\\'s evil . \\neven the final scene of the film , which normally i would just hate , seems strangely appropriate for this film . \\nso much so that i didn\\'t mind it in the slightest . \\nand another bonus : the film takes place in san francisco , which usually means a car chase on those hills that you\\'ve seen a billion times before . \\nand for a moment , it looked as though it was about to happen . \\nbut it doesn\\'t , and that\\'s creative . \\n[r] \\n',\n",

       " b'when the haunting arrived in theaters , all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects . \\nwhile i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , i don\\'t think that they are completely to blame for this movie\\'s failure . \\nit appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the \" unseen \" terrors , and it was about as scary as a dust bunny . \\nso special effects or not , if the story isn\\'t the least bit scary , you aren\\'t going to end up with a very frightening movie . \\nthe thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern . \\ndern is always great , and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie . \\nas i sat through the seemingly endless , albeit fairly impressive , special effects , i kept wishing that this movie was about dern\\'s caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast . \\nnever a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie . \\nliam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear . \\nhe decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion . \\nhe tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia . \\nand he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings-on . \\ncatherine zeta-jones , lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects . \\nlike the original , taylor\\'s character is the star of the movie . \\nbut since she doesn\\'t quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms . zeta-jones , their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original . \\nand let\\'s face it , probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta-jones . \\ni\\'ll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren\\'t in it . \\nbut the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets . \\nthey take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients . \\nthere really isn\\'t much of a story here . \\njust endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with . \\nand the special effects are great . \\nin many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere . \\nin other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the \" cool shots \" quota . \\nat no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary -- funny , maybe . \\nbut not scary . \\nthen we have the set . \\nwhen i first saw the house , i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it . \\nbut it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did , and decided to take the idiotically overdone route . \\nthis included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves . \\nwhat part did these rooms play in the story ? \\nabsolutely none . \\nthey were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie . \\nthen we have the actors . \\nlili taylor has never been one of my favorites . \\nand when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in , she comes in around the average or slightly below mark . \\ni have no idea why liam neeson took this role . \\nhe basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus . \\nhis character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him . \\ni have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman . \\nzeta-jones was cast because she is too hot for words . \\nthe fact that her character is bi-sexual is just icing on the cake . \\nall catherine has to do in this movie is look good . \\nfortunately that is something she does very well . \\nwhile she does have a fairly good size part , it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eye-candy . \\nit\\'s too bad someone of her talents wasted them here . \\nany random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role . \\nthe haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999\\'s horror movies , the blair witch project . \\nthe haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget , while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares . \\nboth prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film . \\nif the story sucks , it\\'s all downhill from there . \\nmy advice ?

       " b'in 1994 , an insider\\'s look at a scandal-ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination ( closely based on clinton\\'s 1992 campaign ) was written anonymously ( former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship ) . \\nnow , the book , primary colors , has been made into a movie , directed by mike nichols , and , in light of recent presidential scandals , seems to be more relevant than ever . \\nbut the film is more than a diatribe against , or a paean in praise of , the president . \\nit is a fascinating look at the political machinery , and the ethical quagmire , that surround modern politics . \\njack stanton ( john travolta ) is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination . \\nhe is charismatic , but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign , and strains his relationship with his wife , susan ( emma thompson ) . \\nthe film is told from the point of view of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , grandson of a civil rights leader , who is swept away by stanton\\'s ideals and helps to organize the campaign . \\nhe joins political strategist richard jemmons ( billy bob thornton , looking an awful lot like james carville ) , and campaign advisor daisy green ( maura tierney ) . \\ngovernor stanton\\'s past repeatedly pops up to haunt him , a fact that his chief rival , lawrence harris ( kevin cooney ) , consistently uses to his advantage . \\nto help clean up the stanton campaign , jack and susan bring in an old friend , libby \" the dustbuster \" holden ( kathy bates ) . \\nthe acting throughout primary colors is superb . \\nit would be worth seeing the movie for bates\\' wild performance alone . \\nshe enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance . \\ntravolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton , although his accent does stray a little . \\nemma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can\\'t let anything show that might hurt the presidential run . \\nthe problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other , or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom . \\nprimary colors treads lightly on this issue . \\nthough stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat , and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans , the movie touches on few actual political issues . \\nin fact , most of the \" bad guys \" are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house . \\nrather than issues , the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control . \\nalthough the film strays into some obviously non-clinton territory , it is difficult to completely separate it from reality ( particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the president\\'s current troubles ) . \\nprimary colors\\' chief problem is its length . \\nit runs about 15 minutes too long . \\nthere are some scenes which could have easily been cut . \\nfor example , midway through the film , the candidate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists . \\nthe scene\\'s only apparent purpose is to establish stanton\\'s character , which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film . \\nthe extra length isn\\'t long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying , but it mars an otherwise excellent film . \\nrepublicans , democrats , and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors . \\nit\\'s a funny , and at some times shocking , look at the modern political process . \\n',\n",
       " b'the tagline on random hearts reads \" in a perfect world , they never would have met . \" \\nin a perfect world , i never would have seen this movie . \\nthe biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film , kay chandler ( kristin scott thomas ) and dutch van den broeck ( harrison ford ) are the only two major characters alive ; resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious two-hours-and-then-some production . \\ndutch is a sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia police department . \\nkay is a congresswoman from new hampshire . \\nalthough they both think they are happily married , their spouses are cheating with each other behind their backs . \\ndutch and kay are soon widowed when a plane goes down carrying their partners ; they subsequently discover the affair . \\nthe rest of the film is the pointless , unrealistic and often-times boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to , and getting to know each other in the process . \\ntwo sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film . \\ndutch is trying to arrest a fellow officer , a task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare . \\nall the great stereotypes get pulled , including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered soon thereafter . \\nkay\\'s distraction from the film\\'s primary focus is her campaign for re-election and attempts to shield her 15 year old daughter from the truth about the father she put on a pedestal . \\nthese sub plots could have made for semi-interesting points , but the film seems afraid to explore politics or mother-daughter relations in depth , and consequently suffers . \\nrandom hearts\\' two primary characters seem to live in shells . \\nalthough both kay and dutch are given their own sub plots , they seem to never deal with anyone other than themselves or each other . \\nthere is plenty of opportunity , dutch having a partner and kay having close friends and her daughter , but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships . \\nveteran actor and director of this film sydney pollack , and critically acclaimed up-and-comer dylan baker both have cameo roles , but be careful not to blink too much or you will miss them both . \\nother than its weak plot , it is hard to criticize random hearts . \\nhowever , it is also hard to compliment it . \\nhad the film taken some small risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have tasted more like a well frosted cake , rather than the dry one that equates to be . \\n',\n",
       " b\"capsule : a ham-handed and over/underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment , so muddled it doesn't even know what it's really advocating , if anything . \\na time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations , and it's easy to see why : it presents a strong , almost rancorously so , story ; it is full of good actors ( samuel l . jackson , matthew mcconaughey , sandra bullock , kevin spacey , charles dutton ) ; and it's ostensibly about some important social issue that we're all tangling with . \\nit is not , however , a good movie , and all of the reasons i've listed above have something to do with why . \\nright from the beginning , the movie is dead-set on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible . \\na pair of redneck whites , boozed and drugged out of their minds , kidnap a young black girl , abuse and rape her horribly , and leave her for dead . \\nafter their arrest , their father ( jackson ) takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial . \\nmcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer , and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics . \\nthe acting is not quite what it should be , given the cast we have . \\nsandra bullock ( who is a good actress but not a serious one ) looks clueless ; spacey's accent switches itself on and off at random ( and he's given a totally thankless role to play as well , a role without an iota of depth ) ; and mcconaughey's role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box . \\nthe most memorable role is donald sutherland's , and his is a bit part . \\ni always consider it an index of a movie's desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events , and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact . \\nthere is one scene -- a riot outside the courtroom -- that should have created incredible tension , but winds up playing out like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this . \\nbecause the movie doesn't know what it's really about , it * can't * generate any genuine tension , and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting . \\none of the ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk cross-burners -- which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic . \\ni was reminded of the despicable betrayed , which tried to tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile , graphic acts of racism as little more than an attention-getter . \\nthe movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes . \\nfirst of all , the jackson character is not hard to judge ; there's no tension in his dilemma . \\nhe's self-admittedly guilty and should be sent to jail , no matter how moral his crusade . \\nthe old saw about how no court in the land would convict him , if he was white , is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie , but it's never developed into an organic component of the story . \\nit just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics . \\nanother mistake is in motivational logic : by not having the two white thugs arraigned first -- or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence , say -- we have that much less empathy for jackson's character . \\ni'm probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped , we are * automatically * supposed to feel empathy for him , but that's precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible . \\n ( see the virgin spring for more on that note . ) \\nis jackson's character then simply insane ? \\nthat prospect isn't given terribly serious treatment either . \\none of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works , or how lawyers get their information . \\nmcconaughey's character makes an important slipup late in the movie , when one of his witnesses turns out to have been convicted of a capital offense . \\nhow did the prosecution get this information ? \\nhow come he didn't get it ? \\nthe whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movie's way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam-bang fashion . \\nthis is the biggest problem : the movie isn't about jackson's character , or his dilemma , or this case , or any of its ( frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction ) characters . \\nit's not ultimately about anything at all , except its stupid geared-down plot , which inches onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards a totally contrived ending . \\nat two and a half hours , the movie is overlong and drastically overwritten : there's endless stuff about things which ultimately add up to nothing , and no writing about the material that should really matter . \\nit's all handwaving . \\nthe closing argument are also sneaky and underhanded , and underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative and unfair . \\nit's not easy to make a movie about something . \\nthe other day i saw kurosawa's phenomenal rashomon , a movie that is really about the way people deal with truth and reality ( or don't ) . \\na time to kill is as empty and ponderous a movie as i've seen in a long time . \\n\",\n",
       " b\"after a stylistic detour with mrs . \\nparker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption . \\nwhile these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie . \\nit is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it . \\nuntil mrs . \\nparker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies . \\ni found equinox , his last pre- mrs . \\nparker effort , to be irritating and frustrating . \\ni was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow . \\nthere are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach . \\nthe characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch . \\nin short , rudolph has created a world that it's worth spending two hours in . \\nafterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples . \\njeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) . \\nfor her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level . \\nall she's interested in is seducing him during those few days when she's ovulating . \\nafter he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor . \\nthe other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they're no more content than jeffrey and marianne . \\na mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart . \\nthey remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won't allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs . \\nthe landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable . \\nthe four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey . \\nthe two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn't take long before they're lounging together , naked , in her pool . \\nmeanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains . \\nthe romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love . \\nsex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it's an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it's a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it's an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness . \\nultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves . \\nthe greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances . \\njonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit-and-tie businessman . \\nthose who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity . \\nlara flynn boyle , who wasn't impressive in rudolph's equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability . \\nnick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph's most pregnant lines with practiced ease . \\nthe clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious as the world-weary phyllis . \\nher often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film's humor , and there's hardly ever a moment when she doesn't steal the spotlight from her co-stars . \\ni don't know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director's earlier productions . \\nenough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters . \\nafterglow is basically a four-pronged character study . \\nthe plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that's the real reason to see this motion picture . \\nrudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction . \\n\",\n",
       " b'when respecting a director , you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect . \\nwoody allen has made a couple less-than good films , and he\\'s my favorite . \\neven martin scorsese hasn\\'t had a perfect track record . \\nkevin smith , after a smashing debut with the classic \" clerks \" stooped as low to sell-out and make the dreadful \" mallrats . \" \\ni mean , so far the only director who\\'s made several films , none of which have been bad is richard linklater ( \" slacker , \" \" dazed and confused , \" \" before sunrise , \" and \" suburbia \" . . . all \\nwhich were great ) . \\nnow , i adore quentin tarantino . \\nhis first two films were classic films , the second one being one of the greatest films of all time . \\nbut 1995 just wasn\\'t that good of a year for him . \\nhe made way too many tv appearances . \\nhe mispronounced jackie chan\\'s name on the mtv movie awards . \\nand he made this film . \\n ( he was also awarded an oscar , so i guess that would be a grand exception ) . \\nrobert rodriguez is also a great director ; not a brilliant one , but a cool one . \\ni\\'ve never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film , so i can\\'t comment on them . \\nbut in this crap ensemble director\\'s film , all four give pitiful efforts . \\npitiful for any director , too . \\nnow in all fairness , ensemble director pieces never really work out . \\ni\\'ve never seen all of \" new york stories , \" but have heard the first two films , by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap ( i saw woody\\'s one , which was hilarious but not totally up to par ) . but i will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film . \\nexposition : a simple one - a bellhop , ted ( the totally overdone tim roth , who\\'s a god and all , but not in this one , though he has a couple good moments ) is working on new year\\'s eve for his first shift ( ! ! ! ) in an old fancy hotel . \\nhe\\'s the only one there ( again : ! ! ! ) and he only has a couple rooms ( yet again : ! ! ! ) . \\nthe old bellhop ( the seemingly immortal marc lawrence - who hated pulp fiction actually ) hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily . \\nas the night goes on , he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile . \\nyea . \\n ( the short films are presented in order , btw ) : \\nthe missing ingredient writer/director : allison anders starring : sammi davis , amanda decadenet , valeria golino , madonna , ione skye , lili taylor , alicia witt \\nthis one starts it off horribly with no plot , no intrigue , and crap dialogue . \\nthe situation is so terrible that it\\'s physically painful to watch . \\nthe plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is ( gasp ! ) \\nstuck inside some object in their hotel room . \\nthe witch that was supposed to bring it ( ione skye ) calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it . \\nyeah , that\\'s what i said . \\nstupid plot , inane characters who aren\\'t interesting at all , etc , etc , etc . the only good thing about this is it has a good cast which , in turn , it wastes pitifully . \\nnot even actually funny for a second . \\nmy rating ( out of 5 ) : no stars ! ! ! ! \\nthe wrong man writer/director : alexandre rockwell starring : david proval , jennifer beals and laurence bender \\nanother bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on . \\nted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple ( david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at \" coming back \" ) who are playing sex games . \\nted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon . \\nbut at least this has a bit of comedy in it , just not that much . \\nand david proval has never overacted as much . \\nand it\\'s \" pulp fiction \" producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window . \\na masterpiece compared to the first one , but still . . . \\nthe misbehavers writer/director : robert rodriguez starring : antonio banderes , tamlyn tomita , lana mckissack , danny verduzco , salma hayek \\nwould a robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek\\'s navel ? \\nnope . \\nluckily she\\'s on the tv dancing so we get to see her . \\nsurprisingly enough , when i read the screenplay ( about a year before actually seeing it ) , this one seemed to have the most potential . \\nit was fast-paced , funny , and well , funny . \\nbut when i watched it , it seemed anti-climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once . \\nantonio overacts nicely and the two kids ( lana and danny ) are funny . \\nbut , as i said , it moves slowly and in that way , it\\'s more painful than funny . \\nbut the ending was stupid and funny at the same time . \\noh ! \\nthe plot : antonio is a supposed gangster ( assumed , really ) who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife ( tomita ) go out to get drunk at a new year\\'s party . \\nantonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long , but things go wrong . . . it \\nwas okay . \\nthe man from hollywood writer/director : quentin tarantino starring : quentin tarantino , bruce willis , paul calderon and jennifer beals ( again ) \\nironically , this one could be considered the best for a bad reason : it best represents what quentin has done with this film . \\nhe plays chester , a spoiled brat actor or something who has just had a huge box-office hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anti-climactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row . \\nthey\\'re drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn\\'t light . \\nthey also pay him a lot of cash . \\nthis is so much exactly what this little film is about that it\\'s campy . \\ntim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves \\'cause they\\'ve had hits , major or minor . \\nit took quentin to realize that . \\nbut the thing is , it doesn\\'t seem like he realizes that . \\nif he did , i\\'d give this a good 3 stars . \\nbut this sucked . \\nit was anti-climactic and the dialogue wasn\\'t very good . \\nhe starts off with a very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes . \\nthat makes no sense . \\nit\\'s cool for a while , then he makes it uneven . \\nit\\'s long and it\\'s just not very good . \\nhopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one . \\nconclusion : what\\'s the moral here ?

       " b'when people are talking about good old times , they actually want to make some bad times look better . \\nnice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s . \\nfor new generations , superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion , cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids . \\nfor people who actually had to live in that period , it was the gloomy decade , marked by lost ideals of 1968 , rampant inflation and unemployment , international terrorism , fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for . \\nfeelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era . \\nmartin scorsese\\'s taxi driver , which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies , is most celebrated of them all . \\nthe movie\\'s protagonist is travis bickle ( robert de niro ) , 26-year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can\\'t sleep at nights . \\nthe job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis , and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world . \\nthe only bright spot in his life is betsy ( cybil sheperd ) , attractive woman working in senator palantine\\'s presidential campaign . \\ntheir date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre . \\nlosing his only link to better side of the world , travis gradually descends into psychosis , becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street . \\nhe purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict . \\nthat conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris ( jodie foster ) , 12-year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi . \\nas many great movies that got cult status through the years , taxi driver became the object of many interpretations . \\nfor some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski - loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty , overpopulated industrial cities ; the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times . \\nfor others , the movie uses raskolnikov-like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade . \\nbrilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides . \\nhis travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation , loneliness and outrage towards crime , drugs , prostitution and senseless street violence . \\nhis pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him , sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents , pimps or job interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero , and too pathetic to be the classic villain . \\nhowever , most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen . \\nbut despite anything , average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis - his crusade against \" scum \" is something that average person wants , but doesn\\'t have a stomach/lack of brains to do it . \\nwhile de niro\\'s travis might come in and out of particular times and places , other persons that appear in the film ( mostly played by the character actors ) give it distinctively 1970s feel . \\nwizzard ( played by peter boyle ) presents the only link with america\\'s better past ; but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he \" knows stuff \" . \\nhis obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade . \\nother characters , on the other hand , show the bad side of new age . \\nmatthew \" sport \" ( keitel , who befriended real-life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime ) is dressed like a hippie ; iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture . \\nporno movies , that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom , are too much even for supposedly \" liberated \" betsy . \\neven the politicians , like senator palantine , are lost in post-vietnam and post-watergate mess ; his broad and senseless \" messages \" that cover the lack of any serious program can\\'t fool even such idiots like travis . \\nthe past is gone , the present is bad , and even the future seems bleak , and the feeling of pessimism can\\'t be washed away even by ironic happy end . \\ntravis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation , and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader\\'s screenplay into the silver screen . \\nnew york city in the night is portrayed as a hell on earth , and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal , almost stygian atmosphere . \\nanother important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman , whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture . \\none of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was , same as his protagonist , famous for the wrong reason . \\ninstead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits , for many years it was tabloid-fodder because of hinckley and his real-life re-enactment of events in the movie . \\nnow , more than two decades later , when some other \" life imitating art \" incidents get more attention , we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory . \\n',\n",
       " b\"once again , the battle is dreamworks versus disney : earlier this year , the mammoth companies fought to the death with their end-of-the-world asteroid flicks , deep impact and armageddon . \\nhere we are now , just a few months later , and they're at it again with dueling bug movies , antz and a bug's life . \\nwhat i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution . \\ni mean , come on -- what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer-animated films about bugs ? \\nas was the case with the meteor movies , disney has come out on top : though antz is a likable movie , a bug's life is far superior . \\nin fact , this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz : i became immersed in the world of a bug's life , while antz just made me scrutinize everything . \\nbut it's not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison . \\na bug's life is a remarkable film in its own right , and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer-animated film about bugs . \\nin fact , it's one of the best films this year : it's smart , subtle , and funny , but it's also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining . \\ni haven't had such a good time at the movies in months . \\nit tells the story of an ant named flick ( voice by dave foley ) ; he's a nice guy , but he's also a troublemaker . \\nthe ants spend all season putting together the offering , a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers . \\njust before the grasshoppers come , flick accidentally knocks over the offering , and ruins everything for the entire colony : the grasshopper's leader , hopper ( kevin spacey ) , is enraged , and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer , or they're all dead . \\nflick , feeling responsible for this , sets off to look for help -- he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them . \\nhe heads to the city ( the city being a house a few miles away ) , where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs : a ladybug ( denis leary , who is spectacular ) , a black widow ( bonnie hunt ) , a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) , a butterfly ( madeline kahn ) , a rhinoceros beetle ( michael mcshane ) , and a stick ( david hyde-pierce , also giving a hilarious performance ) . \\nflick doesn't know they're actors , and they don't know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers , so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position . \\nthe most obvious element of a bug's life is the quality of animation . \\ncreated by pixar , the same people who brought us toy story , a bug's life has some of the most amazing visuals i've ever seen . \\nthe bugs seem to inhabit a three-dimensional space , and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action . \\nthis is a lush , colorful world , full of life and imagination : the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives ( matches , bottlecaps , tin cans , etc . ) and make them active objects in the bugs' world is innovative . \\nthe film is also mercilessly exciting , particularly in a superbly-staged scene involving our heroes' escape from a bird ( a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening ) . \\nbut the makers of a bug's life know where the importance lies : story and characters . \\nflick , with solid voice work from foley , is a great guy to lead the story . \\nbut the real treat comes with the circus bugs ; they're such a likable group of characters -- the standouts are the stick ( hyde-pierce is so good ) , francis the ladybug , and the big fat caterpillar . \\nall of these bugs have more than a token personality , which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs , and it also keeps the tear-jerking scenes from seeming obligatory . \\nin my review of antz , i said that the film is a clever cop-out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant-like existence . \\nin concept , a bug's life is basically the same movie , except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didn't like about it . \\nwith such strong work in both animation and script , a bug's life is nothing but a joy to sit through . \\nit really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie , but a bug's life is so good that i'm sure it will find its audience . \\nafter a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies , it's downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty . \\n\",\n",

       " b'when critics attack seemingly well-intentioned films like patch adams or more recently pay it forward as i am about to do , their opinions are often greeted with a backlash of angry e-mails , sometimes even mock death threats from those who ( i suppose ) like to be shamelessly manipulated by their entertainment . \\neven politicians ( ! ) \\ntend to dismiss film critics as heartless cynics for occasionally dumping on good-hearted films while praising \" filth \" like pulp fiction . \\nthese [fill in the derogatory term that you are comfortable with] tend to forget that a film critic\\'s job is to review the movie , not the message , however sweet and endearing that message may be . \\nthusly patch adams isn\\'t a bad film because it\\'s about a doctor who cares for his patients ; it\\'s a bad film because it\\'s a calculated piece of brazen audience exploitation . \\nsimilarly while pay it forward may have its heart in the right place ( though i even doubt that , stay tuned , an explanation is forthcoming ) , it\\'s still an unpleasantly maudlin mess . \\nthe picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher ( a somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey ) , with a burn scared face and equally singed attitude , who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world . \\n12 year old trevor ( haley joel osmet ) , a disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother ( helen hunt ) , comes up with the notion to pay it forward ; this entails a person doing one good deed ( call it an uber favor ) for three others , then telling them to do the same for three others and before long we\\'re all living in a frank capra movie . \\nmeanwhile in a parallel story , a weasely reporter ( jay mohr ) tracks the \" movement \" which has apparently begun to grow . \\npay it forward has odd ideas about tone ; at certain points it hurls a smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate antidote to the unrelenting sappiness at its core . \\nit\\'s as if director mimi leder didn\\'t have the confidence to make pay it forward the way she intended , and compromised out of fear that her film wasn\\'t \" gutsy \" enough to earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for . \\nso the picture adds grit ( a child molester propositions trevor , a homeless man returns to heroin after being \" saved \" , a character is knifed while doing a good deed , etc ) though it seems shallow , incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself isn\\'t quite sure if it\\'s ready to buy into its own utopian blather . \\npay it forward offers \" crowd pleasing \" elements for general audiences ; jay mohr\\'s umpteenth variation on the waspy sleazeball , angie dickinson\\'s earthy alcoholic bag woman , and the jive-talking \" black hoodlum with a heart of gold \" ( coming on the heals of the black , god-like inmate embodied by gabriel casseus in bedazzled , this may just be the beginnings of a brand new guilty white liberal clich ? . \\nhurray for hollywood ) who actually calls the mohr character a \" nigga \" and says things like \" can you feel me ? \" \\nleave it to pay it forward to happily include a little minstrel act for our further enjoyment . \\n ( maybe spike\\'s flick wasn\\'t so misguided after all ) . \\nthese scenes feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you\\'ll find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings . \\nwhile the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is a film that could make the world a better place , to me the final product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience . \\nit\\'s a picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration , with the main players ( all previous oscar winners or nominees ) given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns . \\none scene in which a slightly de-glamed helen hunt ( de-glamed here means that not only is she a fashion victim [her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama] , hunt\\'s hair is also natty and badly bleached ) verbally castigates spacey , feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip . \\nspacey , of course , responds in his cultured monotone , that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance . \\nmaybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating ; though how can he not , even when he\\'s emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference . \\nthe usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender . \\nin one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet , immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand in that very same stroke , and with said hand still on said mouth , she actually begins convulsing ( dry heaving really ) , then ( and i\\'m not making this up ) she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart in a frenzied search for alcohol . \\nthe scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as a parody of hackneyed tv movie blow-ups ; it\\'s all very theatrical , especially hunt\\'s performance , which feels like a pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar . \\npay it forward has the dubious distinction of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldn\\'t get academy awards . \\nthe picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists . \\neven haley joel osemt , the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense , seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections . \\nhis acting has become broader , less intimate ; it\\'s as if we can make out the little munchkin\\'s thoughts : \" boy this outta floor em \" . \\nnaturally osmet is made to play one of those only-in-the-movies children , a martyr-figure who cleans up after his mother , lectures her on the ills of drinking , and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual teacher . \\nnever mind that the two couldn\\'t be more dissimilar ; his mother is trailer trash dopey , and the teacher is one of those dennis miller-ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary . \\nnevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair together in a scene that recalls parent trap-ish cornball antics . \\nbut oh how we love bright , articulate , self-sacrificing children who pick adults up by their bootstraps and guide them through life . \\nthey\\'re so adorable . \\nof course the blame can\\'t all be hoisted onto the actors ( though with the exception of the little kid , they probably should have known better ) , instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder , who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er , then went on to make two awful genre films in a row . \\nthe first being the peacemaker , a witless post-cold war george clooney vehicle , and deep impact , one of the two films of 1998 to squander the premise of earth\\'s possible demise by a crazed meteorite . \\nthe first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich ? s , and a complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement , not aided by an ending which actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with digital read out ( apparently present for an invisible audience ) . \\ndeep impact has more in common with pay it forward ; it\\'s a movie that treats earth\\'s impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms , completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet would be a goner within days . \\nthe film was full of inspirational speeches where people really said nothing , though the sappy score swelled up to make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching . \\nin pay it forward leder continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming almost like a rebuttal : \" see my movie isn\\'t as na ?

       " b'let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years . \\ni am not too fond of ted turner\\'s world championship wrestling , however , and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight . \\nthe plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs ( david arquette , aptly cast as a neandrathal ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than a flashy show . \\nwhen they finally get to see their hero , wcw world champion jimmy king ( played by oliver platt . \\ni personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king ) , he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair ( a wasted palitaliano , in a role originally meant for real-life wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later , and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff , they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it ) , they embark on a quest to find him and help him get his title back . \\nwhen they find him , they discover in horror that jimmy king\\'s real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv . \\nking is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king . \\nafter convincing king that they don\\'t care that his persona isn\\'t real , gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro , after which sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcw\\'s pay-per-view . \\ngee , whiz , there are so many things wrong with this movie , i don\\'t know where to begin . \\nyes , i do . . . \\n1 . the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff , wcw president who thought up this project , thinks of wrestling fans . \\nhe thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously . \\nhe actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously . \\ni got news for you , eric : nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that , this is 2000 , you know , not 1985 ! \\ni know he\\'ll probably cover arguments up by saying it isn\\'t meant to be taken seriously but it is , because that\\'s how big an ego bischoff has . \\n2 . there was a documentary made in 1998 , wrestling with shadows , that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation , vince mcmahon\\'s screwing bret \" the hitman \" hart out of the title . \\nthis movie\\'s storyline is basically a comic rip-off of that plot with the poor man\\'s wayne and garth thrown in . \\neric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair , but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon , and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart . \\n3 . \\nthe movie\\'s main wrestler , jimmy king , has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him . \\nno wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age , we want bad asses today ! \\n4 . why make this a comedy , instead of an emotional , rocky-style drama ? \\ni know wrestling isn\\'t a sport , but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally makes it in the end . \\n5 . \\nin the movie , gordie starts up an ill-fated romance with nitro girl sasha ( the lovely rose mcgowan . \\nwhat she sees in that freak marilyn manson i\\'ll never understand ) , only to find that she has hospitalized king\\'s trainer for sinclair . \\nwouldn\\'t it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy-girl-for-the-bad-guy cliche ? \\ni hate that . \\n6 . \\nlast , but certainly not least , there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would happen , nor did i laugh once either . \\nthe world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie , for these reasons : \\n1 . they\\'re the better promotion . \\n2 . they have better and younger talent , performers and wrestlers . \\n3 . \\nthey give their fans what they want and don\\'t treat them like idiots . \\n4 . they\\'re winning the ratings and they\\'re the promotion everybody cares about . \\n5 . simply put , they could make a movie a hundred times better , and they could do a wrestling movie the right way . \\nthe only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end . \\nand if i spoiled it for you , good , i saved you from wasting seven dollars . \\n',\n",
       " b'the thought-provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of \" leila , \" a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui , that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty-year career to gain u . s . distribution , thanks to first run features . \\nalthough unfamiliar with mehrjui\\'s previous directing efforts , perhaps the reason for this is that , while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country , the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers . \\nset in modern-day iran , \" leila \" begins on the birthday of the title character ( leila hatami ) , after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband , reza ( ali mosaffa ) . \\nas leila and reza set off to visit his parents , and then hers , where a birthday celebration has been planned , things seem rosy for the couple on the outside , but for leila , life isn\\'t quite as sweet . \\nearlier , on that very same day , leila had gone to see her physician , and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child . \\nwhen all of the conditions are ruled out , and leila passes up the possibility of adoption , reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her , and doesn\\'t care at all about having children . \\nnonetheless , leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby , which is the societal norm , and her self-esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother-in-law ( jamileh sheikhi ) , whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news ( reza is her only son ) . \\nbluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and , in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition , she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with . \\nleila hesitantly agrees , and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens\\' inadequacies , reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like , even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn\\'t give her full blessing . \\nthere are no easy answers to be found within \" leila , \" a film that thoughtfully examines the central character\\'s unfortunate plight , as well as the inner workings of leila herself , told through matter-of-fact narration . \\nalmost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother-in-law\\'s requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman . \\nmaybe because \" leila \" is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence . \\nleila , however , is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily , but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy , no matter what the circumstances . \\none of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza , who married only three months after their first meeting , but obviously love each other very deeply . \\nit is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible . \\nalthough seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another . \\nditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her . \\nthese \" small \" moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman . \\nleft there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage , foolishly unbeknownst to reza , leila prays each time that the date will not go well , so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer . \\nrefusing to stay over at her parent\\'s house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below . \\ndespite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him . \\nsure , the whole second marriage was his mother\\'s idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn\\'t he ? \\nin the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair . \\nunlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words . \\nevery bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else . \\nfor all of its strong aspects , \" leila \" isn\\'t a perfect film . \\non a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed . \\nand concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before . \\nmehrjui\\'s decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice , particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother-in-law , played memorably by jamileh sheikhi . \\ndespite these minor missteps , \" leila \" is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york\\'s cinema village , and then on may 21 in la . \\nthe thought-provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales , and when the climax arrives , leila\\'s self-worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation , to which there is no return . \\nit\\'s difficult to not consider how leila\\'s culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided , had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila , the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme , was going through . \\n',\n",
       " b'quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers . \\nafter his pulp fiction , many actors began receiving many offers for jobs . \\njohn travolta made his come-back and is now one of today\\'s most bankable stars . \\nbruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor . \\njackie brown , on the other hand , boasts quite a well known cast , except for the main lead : pam grier . \\nmost likely you have heard of her and seen her in films , but she\\'s never really had a breakthrough performance ( her first film was in the roger ebert-written beyond the valley of the dolls ) . \\nthat is , until now . \\njackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino , whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction . \\nafter mediocre acting jobs , tarantino returns to what made his name a household one : directing and writing . \\njackie brown is the result , and it is fantastic entertainment . \\ndespite excellent direction from tarantino , the cast steals the film , giving one good performance after another . \\npam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown , and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent--samuel l . jackson , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , and robert forster . \\nmore than likely , you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations . \\ndescribing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult , as you really can\\'t say much or you spoil it for everyone else . \\ni will tread lightly . \\njackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown ( grier ) in a blue outfit walking through the airport . \\nthe camera tracks along with her , and ends up revealing her occupation . \\nwe are also introduced to ordell robbie ( jackson ) , who sells illegal guns to interested buyers . . . \\nfor a hefty price . \\nms . brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away . \\nhowever , an fbi agent ( keaton ) and a local l . a . cop ( michael bowen ) are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money . \\nthey try to reach him through beaumont livingston ( chris tucker ) , one of ordell\\'s buyers , but he mysteriously ends up dead . \\nthey try again through brown , but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong-doing . \\nbut after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell\\'s friends ( fonda ) , she is caught and sent to jail . \\nordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent , max cherry ( forster ) , and then wants to find out what she told the cops . \\nafter she claims to have said nothing , she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison . \\nordell doesn\\'t like this , but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track . \\nthis scheme seems to be going as planned , but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal . \\nrevealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown , and that\\'s the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film . \\ntarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments ( and slang terms ) , but they are always done very well and believably . \\nhis hitmen are normally cruel , but pleasant , in that nasty sort of way . \\nthey talk like normal people , except for when doing business , and they are rude to their girlfriends . \\nof course , this is a tarantino film , and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise . \\nand perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop . \\nof course , tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film , adding a lot of his reservoir dogs-style storytelling to it . \\nthings are told from one person\\'s perspective , and then from another , and then from another , each time learning more and more . \\nthis all leads up to a very interesting conclusion , which decides who is on whose side . \\non the technical side of jackie brown , quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his 1994 film . \\nhowever , this time around it isn\\'t as nearly as impressive or original . \\nthe writing , on the other hand , is quite good , although i do find tarantino\\'s use of slang terms offensive . \\nthe story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction , but it\\'s much more easy to understand . \\nhis previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation , but jackie brown is very simply to follow , especially considering that the time is given during the \" leaps \" in time . \\nperhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel \" rum punch \" by elmore leonard . \\nthe dialogue is pretty much intelligent , and all the characters are fully realized . \\nthe cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro ( who has worked with tarantino on previous films ) and the editing is very good . \\nand as with pulp fiction , the music is a highlight , bringing back memorable songs from the 70s and 80s . \\nthe acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable . \\nthe performances are incredibly rich , with hidden meaning behind every characters\\' actions . \\nnothing is quite as it seems , and you can\\'t really tell which side one person is on . \\nthe real treat , of course , is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown . \\nher poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits , which play an important role in the film . \\nwatching grieg , i could tell what was going through her mind , even if i didn\\'t know what she was thinking . \\nher face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad , happy , or in deep thought . \\nbridget fonda gives a very good performance as a druggie couch potato . \\ni didn\\'t even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits ( her performance actually reminded me of heather graham\\'s in boogie nights ) . \\nmichael keaton comes across very well , as does michael bowen . \\nchris tucker has a small , but effective performance . \\nsamuel l . jackson is very good , but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction ( although much less cynical ) . \\nbut no matter . . . \\njackson is very strong in his role . \\nrobert de niro is actually a little annoying at times , but overall he does a good job as one of ordell\\'s perspective clients and friends . \\nrobert forster gives one of the best performances in the film , as he has one of the most developed characters . \\nhe is present throughout most of the film , and he holds his own against jackson and grier . \\njackie brown is rated r for language , sex , violence , drug use , and some offensive remarks . \\nas a film by itself , jackie brown is a terrific piece of entertainment , with a complex plot to draw viewers in . \\nhowever , one can not help but compare it to tarantino\\'s pulp fiction , and expect great results . \\nwhen compared , it comes up short , but not that short . \\nit\\'s a worthy effort , with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino . \\nperhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress . \\ni can\\'t remember seeing her in anything ( except for a

       " b'in chocolat , a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures , patterns , and lines , hoping she\\'ll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they\\'ll most enjoy . \\nsome scoff the idea , but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next , revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before . \\nthis can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole : on the surface , it appears to be a light , fluffy fable with no depth or true worth , but when one takes a second , deeper look , chocolat\\'s true colors begin to shine through . \\nmaking a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom\\'s chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted-not to mention one of the best films of the year . \\nwhat gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom\\'s 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what\\'s on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences . \\nthe bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness . \\nchocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion . \\nthe bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non-religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth-watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens . \\nmany are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne\\'s opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon-like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business . \\non the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne\\'s shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent-koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie-ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does . \\nalso a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends . \\njuliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne , genuinely capturing her character\\'s determination to turn the narrow-minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat\\'s success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses . \\nlena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs . \\njudi dench is sharp , incisive , and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin . \\ncarrie ann-moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen , crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously . \\nvictoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always-on-the-move mother will eventually settle down . \\na trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : \" five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie . \" \\nthat\\'s not to say the men don\\'t do their share , though : alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o\\'conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne . \\nthe technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film . \\ncinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and rachel portman\\'s masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules . \\nchocolat , adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel , is a wonderful little treat of a film , one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter , and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter . \\nwhile not as powerful as the cider house rules , lasse hallstrom\\'s chocolat is a film which works on all levels-as a drama , a comedy , a fable , a romance , and a fairy tale . \\nand it even lives up to its name : it is delicious to savor the taste of , easy to digest , and , like all excellent chocolate , it is memorable for days afterward . \\nthe bottom line : chocolat is pure pleasure . \\n',\n",

       " b'in the wake of the smashing success of \" rumble in the bronx , \" it\\'s looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release . \\nrumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii . \\nthe version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it\\'s widescreen and bilingually-subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days . \\navailability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng . \\nthe subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small . \\nalthough the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you\\'re reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it . \\nto be fair , i must admit that i\\'ve never been very fond of \" period-piece \" martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past . \\nperhaps it\\'s because most of those i\\'ve seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it\\'s because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant . \\nin fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end . \\nor , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc . ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts . \\nhaving said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i\\'ve seen , and i quite enjoyed it . \\nsurprised ? \\nwell , so was i . \\ndrunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu . \\nwhere he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong\\'s practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu . \\napparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i\\'ve heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i\\'ll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better . \\none of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the \" once upon a time in china \" movies , but i have not yet seen those . \\nthe plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you\\'re watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren\\'t expecting something on the order of \" war and peace \" . \\nthe story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china\\'s cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill . \\nhowever , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong\\'s perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs . \\nthe macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners . \\nin the beginning , fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer . \\nin the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng . \\nafter fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners\\' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general\\'s son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng . \\nand so it goes . \\nand the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong\\'s girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i\\'ve already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves . \\nlet\\'s move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the \\naction . \\nthere\\'s plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of \\ncourse , in a kung fu film , that\\'s to be expected . \\nhowever , this isn\\'t just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius . \\nthe primary martial arts \" style \" featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk . \\nfurther , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but \\nthere\\'s a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor . \\nunder normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair . \\nthe kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i\\'ll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching . \\nanother thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work . \\neven without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film . \\namong other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) . \\n ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . ) \\nunlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked . \\ndrunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( \" a better tomorrow \" 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the \" heroic trio \" series , \" rumble in the bronx \" ) . \\nthe performances are first-rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film . \\nthe scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong\\'s father\\'s back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei-hong\\'s mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband\\'s anger away from fei-hong ) . \\njackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he\\'s in fine form all through drunken master ii . \\nas far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film . \\nit\\'s nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s . \\nthe picture is crisp and clear . \\none thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i\\'ve ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was blocked out above and below . \\n ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . ) \\nit will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release . \\ndrunken master ii shows the full potential of \" period piece \" kung fu movies , and it\\'s good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies . \\nthe plot does meander a bit , but that\\'s to be expected in this type of film . \\nif you like this kind of movie , you\\'ll love this movie , and if not , well , give it a chance anyway . \\nif nothing else , the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental . \\n',\n",

       " b\"i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years . \\nit was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood . \\nbut of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years , i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex . \\nyes , more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me , trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster . \\nfor all teenagers , it's almost like a rite of passage . \\nand what we did was sometimes downright nasty , sometimes funny , and sometimes shocking . \\nand all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer . \\n`american pie' is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year . \\njust how great are their hormones raging ? \\none of them notes , after watching disney's the little mermaid , that ariel is soooo hot . \\nthe four schoolmates are kevin , oz , finch and jim . \\nkevin is the only one with a steady girlfriend , but doesn't want to have sex until the time is just right . \\nbut what is the perfect time ? \\nthere is just no way to know , and that frightens him . \\noz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive . \\nhe joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages . \\nfinch is the phobic hermit who doesn't stand a chance with any girl . \\nso , he pays someone $200 to start spreading rumors about his prowess . \\nsuddenly , girls are lining up to go out with him . \\nbut among these friends , it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful . \\nwhen he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student , his inexperience comes shining through . \\nhe has much to learn , and will do anything to seek out this kind of knowledge . \\nthis may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with mom's apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking , raunchy , yet unbelievably funny . \\nthe one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its `r' rating . \\nthere is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that `there's something about mary' was gloriously ribald . \\nin fact , at first this film received a sinful nc-17 rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a teen-accessible rating . \\nbut i guess after seeing the no-holds-barred coarseness of south park , this seems tame by comparison . \\nteens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest . \\nbut unlike many teen sex comedies , there is a genuine intelligence at work here . \\nthese are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex . \\ntheir plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences . \\nthey know what they want , yet temper it with responsibility . \\nbut almost always , it's impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster , and it's these episodes that make `american pie' such a carnal delight to watch . \\n\",\n",

themselves , and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch \" last year at merienbad \" until they can grasp the idea of content and plot . \\nno amount of hype , no amount of money can

interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs . \\nwe are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship ( a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins ) . \\nwell , the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature . \\nlater , a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache ( jean reno ) interview the sole survivor . \\nin a state of shock , the only thing the man can utter is the word \" gojira \" ( the japanese name of the famed beast ) . \\nwe are then introduced to dr . nick tatopoulos ( matthew broderick , with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film ) . \\nhe is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population . \\nhe is immediately drafted by the u . s . military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature . \\nin a short amount of time , another fishing boat ( loaded with canned tuna from the u . s . and korea for some reason ) is found grounded in jamaica . \\nwell , it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york . \\nwhen the beast finally appears , he tears up one building , stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert ( thumbs up for new york ) . \\nthe military , with dr . tatopoulos\\'s help , have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system . \\nit finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr . tatopoulos who snaps the beast\\'s picture . \\nthe monster eats the fish , the military starts shooting , and the chase is on , with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage . \\nworking from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple , dr . totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open ( even though new york has been evacuated ) . \\nwell the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant . \\nneedless to say , no one believes the good doctor about his discovery , so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster\\'s nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city ( even though the monster isn\\'t dead yet ) . \\ni sincerely hope that i\\'ve completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film . \\ni gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour\\'s wage on this tripe . \\neverything about \" godzilla \" reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast . \\nthe script ( and let\\'s be clear here ) by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years \" razzie \" award . \\nthe dialogue between maria pitillo ( as audrey timmonds , dr . tatopoulos\\' estranged girlfriend ) and mr . broderick is so adolescent , it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as happened during the screening i witnessed ) . \\nthe film could be enjoyably campy if it didn\\'t take itself so damn seriously . \\nbut to what end , as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature , nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind . \\nno . godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it . \\nthe film is bleak and ugly looking . \\ntaking place at night during a rain storm , the movie has little or no depth . \\neverything is ugly and dark . \\nnew york has never looked so inhospitable since \" death wish \" . \\nin an attempt to give the film some color , audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film

interesting plot holes in the film ( this activity , is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game ) : \\n1 . ) why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs , and how do those eggs fuse into one beast ? \\n2 . ) why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate ( such as new york ) to nest ? \\ni don\\'t think iguana\\'s have a habit of migrating . \\n3 . ) how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system , slice a submarine in half , yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin ( in comparison ) steel cable on the brooklyn bridge ? \\n4

radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures . \\n ( note : each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide . \\ngodzilla would have to be over 1 , 000 feet tall to carry them all ) . \\n6 . )

on foot . \\n8 . ) taxis can out maneuver godzilla . \\n9 . ) godzilla can burrow through the subway system but can\\'t tear through the park avenue tunnel . \\n10 . ) why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla ? \\nmaybe a giant hermit crab in the sequel . \\n11 . ) galapagos iguana\\'s actually live in the french polynesian islands ? \\n12 . ) why was dr . tatopoulos brought in by the military if they were not going to listen to him anyway ? \\n13 . ) how did they evacuate new york island in less than a day , and how did they convince those new yorkers to go to new jersey ? \\n14 . ) new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting . \\nnew yorkers hate beta cam . \\ni could go on and on , but that would only serve to make the film seem more enjoyable than it is . \\ndon\\'t be fooled , this film has less gray matter than any episode of \" america\\'s funniest home videos \" . \\nthe performances in the film are singularly bland . \\nnot one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror . \\nthe characters , in the midst of the onslaught , have time to stop and discuss the lack of good coffee , failed relationships , career choices . \\nthe only common occurrence that doesn\\'t take place here is having one of the characters have a bowel movement , but then that would have made them believable . \\ngodzilla for the most part is okay . \\nthe design of the beast is funky , if not very memorable . \\none thing that comes to mind-- the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark , namely his atomic breath . \\nnow , i for one can\\'t quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait . \\na good comparison would be to make a superman film and eliminate his ability to fly . \\nthere is so much wrong with this film that i can\\'t really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted ( except for my

       " b\"in some regards , making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it . \\ntry too hard , and it snaps ; but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther . \\nin simon birch , director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique : he takes advantage of caution and poise , but also risks his movie with a few bold steps . \\nin the end , he's not only holding an unbroken band , but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature . \\nthere's no doubt about it : the film that johnson has crafted is rich . \\nhe chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown , maine - leaves turn bright orange in the fall , the grass is a lush green , pure white snow falls in the winter , and the sky goes on forever . \\nthe characters continue that turn : our two leads are simon birch ( ian michael smith ) and joe wenteworth ( joseph mazzello ) . \\nsimon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital , and by age twelve he's only two feet tall . \\njoe is the bastard son of rebecca ( ashley judd ) , and by age twelve he's ready to know who is father is . \\nnaturally , the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together , from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball . \\nin a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith , simon birch is convinced that he's god's instrument , and there must be a reason he's so small . \\njoe doesn't quite buy it , but he sticks by simon ; the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other's only true friends . \\nearly on , the two meet up with ben goodrich ( oliver platt ) , rebecca's new boyfriend , and although the bond isn't immediate , ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other . \\nboth platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability . \\nthe audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon , a testament to the acting jobs of both . \\nfinally , jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day , and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show . \\nmark steven johnson's sense of drama and writing is fantastic . \\nthe script is loosely based on john irving's novel , a prayer for owen meany , but it's so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from 'based on' to 'suggested by . ' \\nalong those same lines , it's almost unfitting to compare the two ; johnson uses tension , humor , atmosphere , and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions . \\nby no means has he developed a project of similar popularity - gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks - but the winning idea remains the same . \\nsimon birch is a different look at a different life , and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come . \\nin the present , however , it's an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at . \\n\",\n",

       " b'synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy\\'s mother , a fledgling restauranteur . \\nunsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman\\'s favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way . \\ncomments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video . \\ntheir proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they\\'re typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) . \\nstalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he\\'s rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) . \\nother than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable . \\nstalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do . \\ninterspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it\\'s implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen . \\nafter these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears . \\nthe narrator states that \" this is the story of daryl gleason \" and tells the audience that he is the stalker . \\nof course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels . \\nif the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked . \\nokay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required . \\nstalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious . \\nthe opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together . \\ndaryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her . \\nultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate . \\nthese plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet . \\nfor some reason , this genre\\'s films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked . \\nstalked is no exception ( it\\'s a cat this time -- found in the shower ) . \\nevents like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you\\'ll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) . \\nstalked\\'s cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either . \\njay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much . \\nhe overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands . \\nmaryam d\\'abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the \" stalked \" of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner . \\nbrooke ( d\\'abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed . \\ntoward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl . \\nto ensure he won\\'t use it as another excuse to see her , brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house . \\ndoes she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ? \\nof course not . \\nshe tries the door , opens it , and wanders around the house . \\nwhen daryl returns , he enters the house , of course , so our heroine is in danger . \\nsomehow , even though her car is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door , daryl is oblivious to her presence inside . \\nthe whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience\\'s suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character\\'s intelligence . \\nstalked receives two stars because , even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched . \\nrated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar , it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are . \\nif you\\'re in the mood for a good suspense film , though , stake out something else . \\n',\n",

       " b\"last summer , a feature-length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning . \\nbased on the famous 60's television show , the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west . \\nbut it sounded promising : the same tag-team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again . \\nand co-star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects . \\ni mean , what could possibly go wrong ? \\nthe answer is just about everything . \\nwild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate . \\nthere are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression . \\nbut the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it . \\nat square one , we have a bizarre case of casting . \\nwill smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series . \\nmy guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved . \\nsmith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him . \\nhe's too much of a joker . \\ni heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible . \\nwhat makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office . \\nthe plot involves west and cross-dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists . \\nthe trail leads to the diabolical dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent . \\nloveless has taken the country's top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns . \\none such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right . \\nthe visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular , seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the western surroundings . \\nunfortunately , all of these effects seem so detached from the story , and can do little to support the film's plot deficiencies , which are undoubtedly the main problem . \\nwild wild west is a running gag that never truly works . \\nmost of the jokes , usually care of smith , die on arrival . \\nif it's one thing that could possibly be the saving grace , it's the performances , and even they are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered . \\nkline is admirable , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot . \\nsalma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon . \\nbranagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film . \\nbut even he is so utterly weird and over-the-top . \\nrarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is . \\ni suppose there's always one turkey of the summer season ; a highly anticipated , big-budget release that manages to completely disappoint . \\nwild wild west is such a movie , and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 . \\nbut it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office . \\nperhaps after this , audiences will be less assured when they see will smith's name stamped on a summer movie . \\nafter such hits as independence day and mib , wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume . \\n\",\n",

\\ninitial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix . \\nwhile it does share some characteristics with both films ( particularly the first forty minutes , which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs ) , the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm . \\nthe buzz around this project is that first-time feature film director tarsem singh ( who won many awards for his video of r . e . m . \\'s \" losing my religion \" ) wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story , and a good portion of this film supports that theory . \\ndespite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments , the cell does feature some remarkable imagery . \\nall of the sequences where we delve into someone\\'s mind are incredibly beautiful ( including the dank mind of stargher , whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h . r . giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video ) , proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe . \\nthe first sequence that takes place in stargher\\'s mind is by far the best , featuring one of the most ingenious traps i\\'ve ever seen in a film ( involving a horse , which no one seeing this film will probably forget ) , a zoo-like display of stargher\\'s victims which are animated like marionettes , and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room . \\nif the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant , but alas , the sequences only become more silly as they go along ( despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film ) . \\nthe cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images , but at least vincent d\\'onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance ( magnified by ten , thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed ) . \\nin my opinion , d\\'onofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film , but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful ( i . e . - \\nthe newton boys , feeling minnesota , the thirteenth floor , and the velocity of gary ) that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him . \\nthe character of stargher is an excellent role for him though , and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him . \\ndetractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film , as it contains heavy doses of both . \\nbesides the nipple ring removal i mention above , there is also stargher\\'s penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs ( prior to his catatonia and capture ) which will have audiences recoiling . \\na sequence where catherine enters stargher\\'s mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting . \\none moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit-like device . \\nas a narrative film , the cell is sorely lacking . \\nas a collection of images though , the cell is extremely well done . \\nalthough the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half , singh has done what he supposedly set out to do : make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together . \\nunfortunately , a well-written script should have been considered too , because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv ( provided , of course , that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos ) . \\n',\n",

       " b\"seen may 19 , 1999 at 5 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . y . ) , theater #1 , with my brother john for $8 . 50 . \\n[theater rating : * * * * : excellent seats , sound and picture] \\n ( critic's note : this review is the longest i've ever written and still only scratches the surface . \\ni'd recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis . ) \\nas my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace' - how do i even write this review ? \\nnever mind the fact that i've been waiting for a new `star wars' movie since i was seven years old . \\nnever mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released . \\nnever mind that there's so much going on in this movie in terms of plot , action , special effects and long-term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn't cover everything . \\nand also like ted does in all of his reviews , i'll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you , the reader . \\nbefore we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film , many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered ( to get the specifics of the film , skip this and the next four paragraphs ) . \\nas has been made obvious for the last several years , another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars' series ( the first of the films was actually episode four , not one ) . \\ngeorge lucas , the creator of the series , has probably just assumed most people know the first-produced trilogy ( `star wars , ' `the empire strikes back' and `return of the jedi' ) is actually the second trilogy , chronologically . \\nin media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order , but i can't recall his reasons . \\nwith this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err . . . \\nsecond trilogy . . . \\nwell you know what i mean ) . \\nand in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which , unfortunately , may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution . \\n[critic's note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed , but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule . \\ncritic's note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics' law of reviewing movies , which as roger ebert coined , `it's not what a movie is about , but how it is about it . ' \\nbecause so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story . ] \\nfirst of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it . \\nwe know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire . \\nwe know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side . ' \\nwe also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi ) . \\nwhat we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth . \\nto me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity . \\nalso , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended . \\nmost notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine . \\nfor those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least ) . \\nwith `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights . \\nunfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained . \\ni didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness . \\nif you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? ) . \\nbut i digress . \\ni've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself . \\nall these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself . \\nwhat we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s . \\nits similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar , but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality . \\nthe basic story is rather sorted , complex and even confusing at times . \\nwe're told that an army known as `the trade federation' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo . \\nwe're not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is , instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly . \\nwe're introduced to two jedi , the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor ) . \\nthe two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet's queen , amidala ( portman ) . \\nthe leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears . \\nhe is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance , and especially that creepy evil voice of his , he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series . \\nsidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person . \\nclearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film , but should be clear to most viewers . \\ni have a feeling we'll delve into his background in the next two films ) . \\nbut it doesn't take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film's story begins to move along . \\nthe film doesn't have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another . \\nthere are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook . \\nthe other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films' screenplays were also limiting . \\nthe sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits . \\nas we already know , the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars' trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story . \\nand here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council . \\nto briefly summarize the story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala's spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation . \\ntheir meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force . \\njinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force , and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter , more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves . \\nthis also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before . \\nin fact , it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before . \\nthe element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary . \\nby the film's third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot . \\nit's funny how the reality of the `star wars' world seems so embedded in mythology , new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence . \\nnot that this technique hasn't been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history . \\nand at least it's all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter . \\nit does border of the cartoonish sometimes , but that's just the film appealing to our inner child , which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society . \\n`the phantom menace' delivers exactly what you'd expect from a `star wars' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness . \\nso many things in the film we've seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited . \\nbut this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies . \\n\",\n",

       " b'preposterous religious action film ( produced by the trinity broadcasting network ) about a code hidden within the text of the bible that when deciphered will lead to the end of the world ( nice of those bible authors to put a doomsday code into the most read book ever eh ? ) . \\nmichael york plays a millionaire diplomat who breaks the code and sets out to become god on earth and fulfill the doomsday prophecies , while casper van dien ( terribly miscast and giving an awful performance as a result ) plays the atheist motivational speaker who must stop him . \\nmichael ironside ( great as always , despite the silly film surrounding him ) plays a fallen priest and right hand man to michael york\\'s character . \\nhere\\'s some subtle character development you may have missed pertaining to ironside\\'s character . \\nnow despite the fact that we see him murder a man in the opening scene , the filmmakers aren\\'t quite sure if their audience will understand that he is evil . \\nhow do they fix that ? \\nmake specific efforts to show that his character is the only one in the film who smokes ! \\nthere are lots of ominous shots of michael ironside smoking . . . \\noooooo scary . \\nbut even that wasn\\'t enough for the filmmakers apparently , as they later have to infer that ironside\\'s character is gay ! \\nit comes out of nowhere and just makes no sense . \\nmy main problem with this film is that , despite the silly story ( which could have been pulled off . . . \\nanything can be made believable if executed correctly ) , the events of the film aren\\'t shown with any sense of urgency or importance . \\nfor example , at one point york\\'s character is declared chancellor of the world or something , and we see one brief , cheesy news report about it . \\nthe movie keeps telling us that the apocalypse is coming , but it never seems that way . \\nthere\\'s no \" world reaction \" to anything . \\nthe omega code is available on dvd from goodtimes home video . \\nit contains the film in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , and includes the original theatrical trailer , a documentary on the making of the film , production notes , and cast and crew information . \\nthe documentary runs about 25 minutes and is actually surprisingly good ( it looks as though it was made for broadcast on tbn ) , and it does a comprehensive job of interviewing practically everyone in the cast and crew ( with the exception of michael ironside , unfortunately ) . \\nthe best thing about it is that whenever crew members are interviewed , they do an excellent job of explaining their profession and exactly what it is they do on a movie set . \\nmost documentaries tend to overlook this . \\ndoomsday expert hal lindsey is even interviewed ( you\\'ll remember his documentary from the 1970\\'s called the late great planet earth , where lindsey speculated that jimmy carter might actually be the antichrist ) . \\nhowever , at the very beginning of the documentary the producers of the film managed to get on my bad side . \\nwhen interviewed they actually have the nerve to say \" ever see raiders of the lost ark ? \\nwell , our film is like that ! \" \\nno it isn\\'t . \\nnot by a long shot . \\n[pg-13] \\n',\n",

\" he bursts out every three seconds . \\nwell , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients . \\nnot everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort . \\nmost of us have to study . \\nand a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn\\'t know a toe from a finger , probably won\\'t be too successful in preventing death . \\noh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to \" prevent death , \" but to \" improve the quality of life ! \" \\nyes ! \\nthat is true ! \\nand you can not do that without studying . \\nyou can not do that without going to medical school . \\nwhat patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later . \\nfollow the rules ? \\nbah ! \\nwho needs the rules ! \\nonly uptight doctors follow the rules . \\nthe real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants . \\nand then there\\'s the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic . \\na free clinic . \\nin the middle of the forest . \\nwhere patients can be taken to be helped . \\nfor free . \\nhow will patients be transported to the free clinic ?

       " b'synopsis : cro-magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion . \\nreluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy-style , ayla grows up to become a blond , feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate . \\ncomments : allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies . \\nshe proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner . \\nthe clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title . \\nnot even her starring role in this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese . \\nit\\'s so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries , and miserably fails , to be serious ) that it\\'s oddly fascinating . \\nthe ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed , wanting to see how this dud plays out . \\nthe clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m . auel . \\nto this day , the book possesses a loyal cult following . \\ni remember a dear friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so-called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother . \\ni have never read this book , but i sure hope it\\'s 10 , 000 times better than its film adaptation . \\nif not , then i\\'m at a complete loss to explain its popularity . \\nthe clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene . \\na young ayla , looking much like drew barrymore in e . t . , \\ntramps about in the woods . \\nwith her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her , the audience\\'s expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered . \\nwhat follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla\\'s mother ( a blonde with fur pants . . . er , \\nleggings ) . \\ntearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera . . . well , \\nas the earthquake slowly recedes . \\na hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch , but the screaming six-year-old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven . \\ni won\\'t detail the story any further ; this seems enough to illustrate my point . \\nthis movie is really stupid . \\nit never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief . \\nalso , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro-magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston . \\nthe movie doesn\\'t just suggest this message ; it whacks the message into the audience with a two-by-four . \\na blond , gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs . \\nshe\\'s of the \" new people \" ; they\\'re of the \" old people \" with \" the memories . \" \\nyep . \\nwe get it . \\nwe get it . \\nthe clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make-up , which surprises me . \\nthe movie depends upon a lot of make-up obviously , but much of it is unconvincing . \\nas stated before , daryl hannah is daryl hannah here ; she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time . \\nthe rest of the characters have dark make-up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt . \\nthe face-painting that\\'s occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind . \\nthis movie also suffers from its new age trappings . \\nmaybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 , but now it sounds dated and cliched , like poorly conceived elevator music . \\nadd to this the film\\'s faux-mysticism , including spirit animals and dream visions , and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you\\'d expect to hear on a 1-900 number , and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious . \\nthe clan of the cave bear is rated r , though it\\'s probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i\\'ve seen in quite a while . \\nit contains several scenes of sex sans nudity . \\nthe violence mostly consists of hunting scenes . \\nthe funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear . \\nthe bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about . \\nalthough this may sound gratuitous , i\\'m sure , it\\'s so cheesy that it probably won\\'t bother most people . \\nthe clan of the cave bear is a bad movie . \\nhowever , as i wrote at the beginning of this review , it does have the distinction of originality . \\ntypically when i think of bottom-of-the-barrel films dealing with early man , fantasy movies involving dinosaurs ( who did not exist at the same time as man ) and raquel welch come to mind . \\nthe clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that , though it\\'s so bad , the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie ( which is why i awarded this turkey two stars ) . \\ni have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version ; however , i\\'m only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie . \\ni shudder to think that it could be otherwise . . . \\n',\n",

\\nchicken pies , of course . \\nco-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : \" creature comforts , \" \" the wrong trousers , \" and \" a close shave . \" \\nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . \\npart of what made the \" wallace \" films brilliantly entertaining was park\\'s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \\n \" the wrong trousers , \" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and \" a close shave \" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . \\nbut in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . \\nnow teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in \" chicken run . \" \\nthe plot is largely lifted from \" the great escape \" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . \\nthing is , the film doesn\\'t feel like it\\'s been lifted from somewhere else ; \" chicken run \" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . \\npart of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? \\npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it\\'s worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . \\nbut they\\'re * chickens * , so it\\'s funny to us . \\nanother thing that helps \" chicken run \" ( and most of park\\'s films ) succeed is the animators\\' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they\\'re cribbing . \\nthere are references to \" the great escape , \" obviously , and \" stalag 17 . \" \\nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both \" raiders of the lost ark \" and \" indiana jones and the temple of doom . \" \\nthere\\'s even a nod to \" the blues brothers , \" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson\\'s nationality and film history . \\nthe \" braveheart \" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \\nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , \" chicken run \" is downright brilliant in its execution . \\nconsider this : since july of last year , i\\'ve seen dozens upon dozens of \" blair witch project \" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \\nout of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \\nwhy ? \\nbecause once you got past the thought that \" they\\'re parodying that \\'blair witch\\' movie , \" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \\nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \\nconversely , \" chicken run \" doesn\\'t lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \\nif you\\'ve never seen \" indiana jones , \" the chase sequence is still fun . \\neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \\npark , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it\\'s understood , and as a result , \" chicken run \" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . \\nenjoyment of this movie doesn\\'t require knowledge of film history , but if you\\'ve got it , \" chicken run \" is that much richer . \\nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it\\'s hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \\nginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on \" absolutely fabulous \" ) nails it . \\nshe has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . \\nthe characters\\' inevitable romance doesn\\'t feel contrived , but sweet . \\npoor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn\\'t any help . \\njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . \\nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that\\'s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \\none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of \" chicken run , \" it comes as a delightful surprise . \\nthe film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . \\nthe animation is first-rate . \\nremember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable \" chicken run \" really is . \\nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios\\' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . \\nas in such top-notch family fare as \" a bug\\'s life \" or \" toy story 2 , \" \" chicken run \" has something to offer in nearly every frame . \\ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they\\'ll catch all the details . \\nanyway , the movie\\'s just a boatload of fun . \\nfunnest damn movie i\\'ve seen all year . \\n',\n",

( \" cast away \" ) , and lawrence konner & mark d . rosenthal ( \" mighty joe young \" ) . \\ndirector tim burton\\'s unique look and style are nowhere to be found in this silly , pointless remake . \\ndavidson no sooner lands than he finds himself being swarmed by savages running in terror , whom he wisely joins . \\nhowever , he\\'s rounded up with the lot of them by the apes which rule this plant and handed over to slave trader limbo ( paul giamatti , \" duets \" ) . \\nari ( helena bonham carter , \" fight club \" ) , daughter of the illustrious senator sandar ( david warner , \" titanic \" ) and simian bleeding heart , believes humans should live with apes on equal standing , an unpopular notion . \\nshe takes a liking to leo , who she deems \\'unusual . \\' \\ngeneral thade ( tim roth , \" lucky numbers \" ) is of the opposite opinion , wishing for declaration of martial law that will allow him to annihilate the race . \\nhe\\'s sweet on ari . \\nit\\'s relatively easy to see where this \\'new\\' story is going from the onset , yet its ultimate revelation has gaping logic holes . \\nthe much ballyhooed \\'surprise\\' ending is a nonsensical let down . \\nan attempt at a love triangle , conveyed by ari and the human daena ( estella warren , \" driven \" ) giving each other \\'back off\\' looks over leo , fails because he never develops a relationship with either of them . \\nthe lone sex scene is some hilarious foreplay between elder orangutan senator nado ( glenn shadix ) and his trophy wife nova ( burton\\'s squeeze , lisa marie ) . \\nguffaws will also likely greet charlton heston\\'s cameo as thade\\'s father , the one ape harboring a firearm ( ! ) who sputters some very familiar lines before dying . \\nthe only real success of the 2001 \" planet of the apes \" is rick baker\\'s makeup , and even that\\'s an iffy affair . \\nno attempt was made to change the human whiteness of the actors\\' eyes , a real distraction amidst some otherwise impressive work . \\nroth , warner and michael clarke duncan ( as thade\\'s right hand man attar ) are given the most impressive makeovers . \\ngiamatti looks more like a skull than an ape and the female apes are too humanized to be given sexual appeal . \\ntim roth delivers the most impressive acting job by getting the body language right - his nasty chimpanzee character leaps about , most spectacularly when mounting his steed , but even\\'s he\\'s undone by some obvious wire work . \\nbonham carter delivers a goodly range of emotion from behind a stiff prosthetic , but is undone in turn by the silliness of the writing . \\nmost of the film has a set bound look which no amount of mist can cover . \\nthe ape\\'s city resembles a dank complex of tree houses . \\nthe apes\\' military costumes ( colleen atwood , \" sleepy hollow \" ) as well as their field tents are reminiscent of eiko ishioka\\'s work on coppola\\'s \" dracula . \" \\nthat oriental flavor is also found in danny elfman\\'s tribal , percussive score . \\n \" planet of the apes \" was the last blockbuster hope for the summer of 2001 , a dismal movie season that\\'s going to the dogs . \\n',\n",
       " b'here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop . \\nokay , it isn\\'t quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart . \\nmost films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them . \\nhowever , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered . \\na lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash . \\nbut , the thing is , it isn\\'t . \\nit\\'s well made , well acted , and quite intelligent . \\ni can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film . \\nbut the species series isn\\'t about the lack of these elements . \\nit\\'s about how much it can get into one film . \\nand yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so . \\nspecies ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe . \\nmany films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film\\'s needs . \\nspecies ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars . \\naboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut . \\npatrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed . \\nwell , it would seem that he has succeeded . \\nlanding on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so . \\nof course , he isn\\'t the first ever . \\nabout a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life . \\nnow , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky . \\nno life lives on it . \\nthat is , no visible life . \\npatrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground . \\nhe takes them aboard , and puts them in storage . \\nunfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship . \\njust prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings . \\nthey pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can\\'t even remember . \\nthey blame it on a technical malfunction . \\nback on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible . \\nas we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet . \\nhowever , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is . \\npatrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge ) . \\neve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien . \\nhowever , this time around , most of her \" alien \" urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant . \\nthe project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable . \\nsince she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again . \\nand it has . \\nstory-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can\\'t tell me it was strong on story ) . \\nwhat surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay . \\nin my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles . \\nthis piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) . \\nthe script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot . \\nbeginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie . \\nand it does it quite well . \\nthe characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do . \\nthe only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does . \\nthere are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects . \\nthe special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad . \\nbut for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) . \\nalso , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone\\'s head being blown off . \\nhowever , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary . \\nmany people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence . \\nhowever , i tend to disagree . \\nwhat were the alien films about ? \\nand , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn\\'t you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ? \\nmy only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store . \\ni didn\\'t realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one ) . \\nthe acting is quite good for this kind of film . \\nit is a vast improvement over the first film , at least . \\nthe acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens . \\nokay , so it isn\\'t that good . \\ngeorge dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting . \\nnatasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage . \\nhowever , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent . \\noh yeah , and she\\'s quite fun to just plain watch . \\nmarg helgenberger is immensely better this time around , and her performance is probably the best in this film . \\nmichael madsen is so-so , but he isn\\'t annoying , and he soon becomes rather appealing ( with his nice cynic personality ) . \\njames cromwell has a small part , but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor . \\nas i say , any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability . \\nmykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance , and he gives the film a more down-to-earth feel . \\nand , of course , justin lazard . \\nlazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance , but i think he is effective . \\nsure , he is wooden , but isn\\'t that what his character is like ? \\nthe moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done , due to the couple\\'s acting . \\nspecies ii is rated r for strong sexuality , sci-fi violence/gore and language . \\nthis is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see . \\nmore than likely , they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives . \\nhell , i don\\'t even know if i will . \\nwhat is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year . \\ni probably won\\'t see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while . \\ndirector peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful , and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series . \\nmedak has also mastered the wonderful \" jump ! \" \\nmoments , and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film ( scream still has the first ) . \\nstrong acting , smart dialogue , intelligent plotting , and a sure-handed director , species ii is exactly what these films should be : entertaining . \\n',\n",
       " b'not since oliver stone\\'s natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary , and not since david cronenberg has a so-called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility . \\nwhile fincher\\'s films have never suffered from a lack of shock value ( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples ) , fight club marks the distillation of his pitch-black comedic sensibility ( see 1997\\'s the game ) into something like a definitive statement . \\njack ( norton , acting as both narrator and protagonist ) is your typical cubicle clone , whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia . \\non the offhand advice of a doctor , he sits in on group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer . \\nhere he meets bob ( marvin lee aday , aka meat loaf ) , a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia . \\nstrangely , the release he finds while sobbing on bob\\'s breasts allows him to sleep at night , at least until a fellow group-therapy \" tourist \" named marla singer ( carter ) comes along to ruin things for him , forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity . \\nlater , he meets tyler durden ( pitt ) , a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life . \\none night , after his ikea- furnished condo explodes ( don\\'t ask-- you\\'ll just have to see the movie , awright ? ) , he is goaded by tyler into a fight , and damned if it doesn\\'t feel good . \\nit is pure , raw existence , a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison . \\nhe moves into tyler\\'s squalid abandoned mansion , and they form the titular organization , an underground therapy group where men bond with bare-knuckle savagery and very few rules , the first two of which are \" don\\'t talk about fight club . \" \\narmed with charisma and an attractive anti-corporate philosophy , tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white-collar slaves and dead-end mcemployees . \\nresentment creeps into jack\\'s heart , made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla . \\nfunded by a frivolous lawsuit , tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem . \\ntheir initially juvenile pranks ( like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads ) quickly evolve into something more like sedition , and jack fears that things have gone sour . \\nit is after this point , when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original , that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist . \\nit is so contrived-- and so conventional compared to what precedes it-- that everything which follows ( including the ending ) becomes far less interesting . \\nit\\'s a major ( though not fatal ) flaw , and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher , it feels like a cop-out . \\nfight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people . \\nin the early going , it has a downright dangerous feel ; it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul , and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it . \\ni\\'ll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don\\'t spring up here and there , and i\\'ll be even more amazed if fincher isn\\'t vilified for it by the same humorless witch-hunters that are currently after oliver stone . \\nthey needn\\'t bother , because fight club is less a message movie than fincher\\'s elaborate attempt at a joke . \\ntyler durden , for all his dionysian allure , is really nothing more than the logical ( and far less hypocritical ) extrapolation of all those self-help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me-first gospel of self-actualization . \\nin this context , the joke works , but like the latest columbine joke , some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh , and others won\\'t . \\nhopefully , though , their silly moral outrage won\\'t spoil the joke for the rest of us . \\n',\n",
       " b'the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do . \\nlives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment\\'s notice . \\nthe negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower . \\nmost of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants . \\nit takes a pretty smart person to do that . \\nbut what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? \\nwhat if he\\'s also able to think on his feet ? \\nin fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? \\nit is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray\\'s the negotiator . \\nin this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force . \\nwhen his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman\\'s home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder . \\nfaced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain\\'s office . \\ni don\\'t quite remember if the captain actually said , \" i hate to do this , but . . . \" , \\nalthough it wouldn\\'t surprise me if he did . \\nluckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . \\nafter being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . \\nwalsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed . \\nalthough roman\\'s actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue . \\njackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman . \\nthe actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats . \\nthe script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence . \\nhow can we believe he\\'s going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? \\nunfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it\\'s would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson\\'s acting ability . \\nalmost every time he\\'s in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back . \\nwhen spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course . \\nhis is an interesting character . \\nmade out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . \\n \" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can\\'t talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , \" he says . \\nwhen he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be . \\nsoon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail . \\nthis complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor . \\nas the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely . \\ngray really lucked out with this cast . \\ndavid morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey . \\nthe only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a . \\nin l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land . \\nwith the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven . \\nalso in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides . \\nhis character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything . \\nfortunately , this doesn\\'t distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . \\nj . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances . \\nsadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . \\nwalsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon . \\nfor one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton . \\nwhen jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) . \\nthe negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . \\nin the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it\\'s reality . \\nwe\\'re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . \\nas an audience , we\\'re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we\\'d like to see if one will dominate the film . \\nboth provide some pretty good entertainment . \\n',\n",

       " b'the u . s . army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done . \\none particular field manual is known as the fm 22-5 , which among other things , covers the practice of saluting . \\nunder the \" saluting \" section is a sub-section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer . \\nthe salute is rendered by the highest-ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail , and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail . \\nin any event , the salute is rendered only by the man ( or woman ) in charge , rather than by the whole group . \\nalmost at the very beginning of the general\\'s daughter , we see a general\\'s motorcade passing a work detail . \\neveryone salutes . \\nit looked impressive , but it just wasn\\'t right . \\nthat little bit showed me that someone either didn\\'t do the appropriate research , or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene . \\nin fact , this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture , as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie . \\nwhat results is a film that looks good , but like that one scene , just isn\\'t right . \\nthe first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example . \\npaul brenner ( john travolta ) is an agent for the army\\'s criminal investigation division , undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale . \\nprior to the transaction , the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isn\\'t the unscrupulous supply sergeant he\\'s supposed to be , and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living . \\nso ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark ( we\\'ll just say that it involves propellers ) . \\nbrenner then receives new orders when the commanding general\\'s daughter , captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , is found naked , bound , and dead on one of the base\\'s training ranges . \\nhe is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder . \\nwhat i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary . \\nit gives no insight into brenner , other than the fact that he\\'s a little cocky . \\ndoes the arms subplot turn up later ? \\nno , so why add this extra running time to the film ? \\nthe answer : it looked cool . \\nor how about the \" atmosphere \" ? \\nthe beginning of the general\\'s daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees , dirt roads , sultry colors over water - all backed up with bayouesque music . \\nnice immersion in the setting , but it soon doesn\\'t matter , for when the film\\'s plot shifts over to the murder investigation , so does the entire mood . \\nno attention is paid to the location of the story , and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme . \\ndid the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie ? \\ninstead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film , we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another , just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside . \\nthe above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie . \\nas i\\'ve already mentioned , an entire section of the film doesn\\'t jibe with the rest , and the characterization only adds to the difficulty . \\nbrenner , who comes across as a man with little respect for authority , suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell ( james cromwell ) and utters some of the corniest \" yes , sir \" s i\\'ve ever heard . \\nhe even delivers an emotion-charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general\\'s daughter , even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous . \\nsunhill , who initially comes across as a professional investigator , utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information , and even revels in her ingenuity . \\nboth characters are protagonists , but it\\'s hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place , and in some cases , simply unappealing . \\ni could imagine that during filming , west would shoot a scene , then take the actors aside and tell them , \" let\\'s do it again , but this time , i want more . \" \\ni say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good , in this film they overact in most of their scenes . \\nan even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general\\'s aide , colonel fowler . \\ni swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention . \\na far cry from his days as linc in \" the mod squad \" , i can\\'t help but think he was acting from west\\'s direction . \\na couple of side characters including a west point psychologist ( john beasly ) and a young female private ( ariyan a . johnson ) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear . \\nthe only two actors who seem to have escaped west\\'s influence are james woods , who provides a good performance as colonel moore , elisabeth\\'s mentor at the psychological operations unit , and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police . \\nwoods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people\\'s minds , and does so without ever taking it over the top . \\nhutton just kind of hangs around , but at least he wasn\\'t overacting . \\ni haven\\'t read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based , but i\\'ll bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form . \\nthe movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space , or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished . \\nevery time we\\'re presented with some new aspect to the case , west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it\\'s the most momentous discovery ever , but the information is not used by the investigators at all . \\ninstead , when conclusions are drawn , they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts , but lucky guesses instead . \\nthe army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill , letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects , then letting them guess who the killer was . \\nwould\\'ve been over in a half hour . \\nthe film finishes with a sort of bookend , featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning . \\nliterally during the closing credits , we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off , then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off . \\nthey both seem kind of happy . \\nmaybe they were driving away from simon west . \\n',\n",
       " b'tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie . \\nthe film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it\\'s evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . \\nenduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious . \\nthe qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium . \\ntectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences . \\nit\\'s not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , \" look ! \\nart ! \" ) , \\nalthough it keeps the audience distanced from the characters . \\nbecause we\\'re constantly made aware that we\\'re watching a play or a movie , it\\'s impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer\\'s ideas . \\nthey\\'re not real , sympathetic , or believable . \\ni\\'m willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success . \\ntectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) . \\none day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself . \\nwhile preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re-think her decision . \\nmeanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host . \\nwith settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else . \\nhowever , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers . \\nthe tone is soporific , the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn\\'t take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious . \\ntectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point . \\nthere are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren\\'t bilingual ) . \\nthe only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it\\'s different , ( b ) it\\'s not like anything they\\'ve seen before , and ( c ) it\\'s pretentious . \\nfor everyone else , it\\'s not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage . \\n',\n",

       " b\"starring william baldwin ; cindy crawford & steven berkoff all right , the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role . \\nnot that cindy does that bad , it's just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy's extraordinary acting skills , but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation . \\nand in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty , but i'm sure that that is just a coincidence , no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet , well , that's just a happy coincidence . \\nsure . \\nwilliam baldwin isn't a bad actor . \\nunfortunately , he just doesn't demonstrate it at all in this movie . \\ni'm not sure if that's because most of his lines were just so hokey , or if he was trying to make cindy's acting look good . \\nif it was the latter , it worked . \\ncindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie . \\nwhich is not to say that she doesn't have room for improvement . \\nalthough to be fair to cindy , her lines were kinda cheesy in places . \\nso right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford , arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet , chose for her foray into the world of cinema ? \\nwell , i'm glad you asked that question . \\ncindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents . \\nwhy woud they target someone as likable as cindy , you ask ? \\nby the end of the movie you won't care . \\nthe story is so contrived it isn't funny . \\nanyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house , without getting so much as a scratch i might add , she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin . \\nwho's character , max kilpatric , a police detective , seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine ( my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal's early films ) . \\nthe point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin's characters of the run from these killer russians isn't all that bad of an idea , it's just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud . \\nthe supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes . \\nif i was baldwin , i'd hope this film disappears . \\nas for crawford , she may indeed have some acting ability . \\nunfortunately , any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad . \\nthis movie was obviously written with cindy in mind , since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks . \\nit's too bad they hadn't spent more time on a half decent plot , since ms . crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much . \\nunless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you . \\n\",\n",

       " b'synopsis : private detective tom welles is hired by a wealthy widow to uncover the origins of a snuff film owned by her late husband . \\nafter uncovering the authenticity of the film , welles descends into an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers . \\ncomments : 8 mm is one of the more disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time . \\nthough it doesn\\'t present a snuff film ( a movie which documents a person\\'s murder for real , usually during or after some form of sexual act ) as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness and violence as shockingly as , say , natural born killers , 8 mm stays in your head long after you see it . \\nit is not fun to watch ; see something else if you get upset by realistic , sadistic violence . \\nthis film\\'s violence and perverse sexuality skirts closely into nc-17 territory . \\nfor those with strong stomachs , however , 8 mm is an intelligent , worthwhile thriller , especially during its second hour . \\nnicolas cage , after a couple ho-hum movies , returns to material which allows him to utilize his strong acting abilities . \\nas tom welles , a private detective and caring family man to a wife and newly-born daughter , cage skillfully and convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowly transforms into obssession and violence as he is pulled into a nightmarish world of underground pornographers and brutal sexual deviants . \\nserving as a guide to this world is joaquin phoenix , who plays a struggling songwriter named max california . \\ncalifornia , despite his name , is a surprisingly intelligent and complex character , and phoenix does a very good job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character . \\nthe real star of the movie , though , must be peter stormare . \\nstormare played the \" really , really evil guy \" in fargo , and his character , dino velvet , in this movie seems about ten times more evil and unpredictable . \\nhis performance is very chilling . \\n8 mm\\'s success may hardly be surprising . \\nit was directed by joel schumacher , who , hopefully , saw this film as an apology for the absolutely dreadful batman and robin . \\nbefore directing the last two batman duds , however , schumacher was responsible for several well-made horror flicks : lost boys , flatliners , and falling down . \\n8 mm certainly joins the rank of these minor classics and is perhaps most reminiscent of falling down in that both films present an average man who self-destructs before the audience\\'s eyes . \\n8 mm was written by andrew kevin walker , who also penned the academy award-winning thriller seven a few years back . \\nlike seven , 8 mm is full of dialogue which haunts you well after leaving the theater . \\nwelles is searching for answers . \\nhow could anyone possibly drug and then slowly , methodically , sadistically kill a teenaged girl to make a film ? \\nwhen confronting one of the perpretrators at the end , the murderer responds that there are no reasons . \\nhe just enjoys it . \\nthat , walker seems to suggest , is where the real terror lays : not in the crime itself but in the fact that rational motives do not exist . \\na couple minor faults led me to my four-star rating ( five stars is the highest rating i give ) . \\none , i found it a little difficult , early on , to accept the fact that a hardened private detective would get physically disgusted when first seeing a snuff film . \\nyes , snuff is a horrible thing , but a detective of welles\\' caliber has probably encountered awful things before . \\nsecond , some of the clues welles gathers are too convenient . \\nhe discovers , for example , the victim\\'s diary in her private bathroom , despite the fact the the police , the fbi , and her own mother have all investigated the room before . \\nfinally , the closing scene seemed trite and improbable considering the rest of the film . \\ndespite the above criticisms , 8 mm is an engrossing story . \\none of the best scenes in the film occurs toward the end as a crazed welles , who no longer seems like a hero , brutally beats one of the pornographers responsible for the snuff film . \\nhe pulls a gun on the man and , for a relatively long amount of time , struggles to decide whether or not to kill him . \\nhe then leaves the building and calls the victim\\'s mother , in the middle of the night , to basically see if she would support the action . \\nthe entire scene is tense , unpredictable , and emotionally charged . \\nrarely , anymore , do horror films or thrillers provoke suspense in me as 8 mm , with scenes like this , did . \\n8 mm is most certainly not for the faint of heart . \\nthis is a graphic , oftentimes unflinching , look into the darkness which resides in both ordinary and extraordinary people . \\nif you\\'re prepared for a film of this nature , i give it an enthusiastic recommendation . \\n',\n",
       " b\"`we run tings . \\ntings don't run we . ' \\n-sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell ) . \\njamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo-styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) . \\ncapone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him . \\nwhen he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) . \\ncapone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him . \\ntorn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again . \\ndirected deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while . \\nshots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn't as hyperkinetic as most of woo's films are . \\nthe action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) . \\nthe make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team . \\nthe cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest . \\npaul campbell , as the `loose cannon' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times . \\nmark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together . \\nunfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed . \\nthe music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) . \\nthe end credit song , `we run tings' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review . \\noddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn't contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us . \\nat the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $500 , 000 us ) . \\npalm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters . \\nchris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so i'd say he has a pretty good track record . \\noverall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong . \\nif action films are your thing and you don't mind intermittent subtitles , then you can't go wrong with this film . \\nthe performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight . \\ni'm not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop's honors are well deserved . \\n\",\n",
       " b\"take a look at the following equation . . . . \\na christmas carol+ghostbusters=scrooged \\nyes , scrooged is the odd mixture of sentiment , comedy and horror you would get if you mixed those two elements toghether . \\nscrooged is alternatively sick , gross , funny , and then sickly soppy . \\nbill murray plays frank cross , a t . v executive with a horrible personality . \\nhe's evil to secretary , actors , crew , everyone , except the t . v's station's boss , of course ( played by the late robert mitchum ) however , he is then visited by a very dead exec , who warns cross that he will be visited by three ghosts , past , present and future ( who is called the ghost of yet to come , for some reason ) sure enough , they arrive , show cross how much of a s . o . b he is , and he changes his way . \\nhowever , throughout this simple plot , we've got to suffer outlandish special effects , poor comedy , and an very , very mean performance from bill murray . \\nfrank cross isn't 'funny' mean , he's just mean . \\nhe also isn't very good at emotional scenes , and totally destroys the last ten minutes of the film , with an utterly desperate speech saying how great christmas is , and how he has changed . \\nhowever , the supporting cast are ok , with good performances from mitchum , allen ( who plays his girlfriend ) and john glover ( who plays cross's 'partner' ) the ghost of christmas past isn't that bad either . \\nsadly , though , the audience has to suffer 25 minutes of 'home alone' style violence from the ghost of christmas present , played by carol kane . \\nwhoever thought smacking that kane smacking murray in the head with a toaster was funny , should be fired straight away . \\nand the audience also has to suffer bobcat goldthwait ( the guy with the annoying voice in police academy 3 , if i remeber correctly . . . . ) \\nwho , thankfully , dosen't say much . \\nthe script is horrendous . \\nmichael o'donaghue churns out terrible , bad taste jokes ( which i guess is the whole point really ) then changes direction completely to emotional scenes . \\nand he must of been on some drug when he wrote the final ten minutes , which are awful . \\nthe special effects look nice , but do nothing for the film . \\nthere's some impressive make up effects also . \\nthe music is also good , which is scored by danny elfman . \\nbut great effects and make up don't make a great film . \\nscrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audience , seeing as the first 1 hour 20 minutes of the film are so depressing anyway , and the last ten minutes had to make up for it with an godawful speech . \\nwhy didn't cross just look out his exec window , and ask a young boy to buy a goose for him ? \\noverall , then , you'd have a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided ( perhaps a plague ) \\n\",\n",

       " b'there\\'s no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based , as its opening credits proclaim , on a true story . \\nbut if it\\'s an accurate picture of life on america\\'s mean streets , than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought . \\nfor from the film\\'s outset , when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles ( not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading ) donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction . \\nour eponymous hero ( johnny depp ) is not the cheap crook he first appears to be . \\nbrasco is joseph pistone , an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming-up to lefty ( al pacino ) , a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a \" wiseguy \" . \\nregrettably , pistone learns his lessons all too well . \\nhis concern for lefty , who is burdened with a heroin addicted son , exacerbates his own family troubles : his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husband\\'s gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing . \\ntrue , the focus on pistone\\'s family life does deviate from the typical gangster-flick formula , but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins . \\nthe unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn-out domestic squabbles ? including an ill-advised marriage guidance routine ? that slow the film down unnecessarily . \\nthe biggest problem with donnie brasco , however , is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors . \\nthe awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70\\'s , but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style ? i loved those fluoro coloured suits ? of scorces\\' costume drama casino . \\nmore importantly , pacino\\'s presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively . \\ndonnie brasco\\'s take on american values , for instance , is feeble and obvious . \\nlefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music . \\ninexplicably , lefty\\'s horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us . \\nit doesn\\'t any more than his family troubles do , which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistone\\'s . \\njust think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface . \\nin these pictures pacino\\'s dedication to a peculiar and bloody hyper-capitalism was twisted and confronting , while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark ? neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations . \\ndonnie brasco\\'s tawdry little crime , therefore isn\\'t so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes , but the shameless way in which it sanitises them . \\n ( oh and by the way , i forgot to mention that the script also sports a startling subplot : pipstone\\'s superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination ? is that a \" damn you mcbain ! \" \\ni hear from springfield way ? ) \\nso the movie is cliched . \\nbig deal , what do you expect from a gangster-flick ? \\nwell you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre . \\ndonnie brasco fails on both counts . \\nthe action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depp\\'s woeful performance tends to smother the good-work of his comrades . \\nadmittedly , pacino does nothing new and michael madsen ( sonny ) simply smirks his way through the picture like a slightly subdued mr . white , but both possess an unmistakable sly charm . \\ndepp usually exhibits a bit of class himself , but regrettably , being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him star-struck , for he is completely hell-bent on mimicking pacino\\'s well-earned high style . \\nthe consequences are painful to watch . \\nits no exaggeration to say that the film\\'s credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone family\\'s uncanny ability to keep a straight face in front of their breadwinner\\'s phony brooklyn accent . \\nperhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco . \\nmaybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks . \\nif this is indeed the case , surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that america\\'s underworld is committed to emulating , albeit in heavily attenuated form , their movie namesakes . \\ndepp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is forced to mimic big-screen gangster greats . \\nwho knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen ? \\nbut then again , perhaps donnie brasco isn\\'t so true after all . \\n',\n",

       " b'i must admit i\\'m going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity , because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend . \\nthe magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity . \\ni am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , but something drew me to this film . \\nmaybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role , and the hilarious eugene levy . \\nmaybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity , con air , and pushing tin . \\nbut maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life . \\nthe story of serendipity is simple . \\ntwo people , john trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale , looking ever so hot ) , have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves -- with buck henry smack dab in the middle . \\ncharmed beyond repair , these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf ? called serendipity , talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down , and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink . \\nbut with each of them already involved with other parties , sara has john write his name and number on a $5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera . \\nsara declares that if this \" thing \" -- let\\'s just call it love -- is destined to happen , fate will bring them together in the future . \\nyears later and on opposite coasts of america , john and sara -- both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates -- decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts . \\nwhat happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat-and-mouse game with the fates - involving such items as mistaken identity , a graduate homage , john corbett as a freaky new age musician , and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman -- to find out if that \" thing \" was right after all . \\nfortunately , first-time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong , well-rounded , characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative . \\ncoupled with deft directing by michael chelsom ( director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones ) and the use of time-lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years -- the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity . \\nboth piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters \\non the flipside , films such as you\\'ve got mail , made in heaven , and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film\\'s main journey at hand . \\nbut it\\'s what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture . \\n',\n",

       " b'it seemed like the perfect concept . \\nwhat better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? \\nit\\'s exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh . \\njim carrey\\'s signed on too ? \\neven better . \\nthe national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers\\' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as \" schizophrenia , \" and so forth . \\nsuch a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers\\' fire , proving that some people just couldn\\'t take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . \\nyes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn\\'t funny . \\nit\\'s not for lack of trying . \\nthe farrellys utilize in \" me , myself & irene \" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them . \\nthis , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . \\nsoon enough , charlie\\'s repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster . \\nthis guy isn\\'t above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he\\'s been insulted , or holding a little girl\\'s head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street . \\nthen things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks . \\nsome have suggested that this isn\\'t a problem , because the farrelly brothers\\' brand of humor doesn\\'t require plot to work . \\nthey\\'re wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys\\' last effort , 1996\\'s \" there\\'s something about mary . \" \\n ( 1999\\'s \" outside providence \" was technically an earlier project . ) \\nthe brothers\\' earlier film wasn\\'t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected . \\nin \" mary , \" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they\\'d have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion . \\n \" me , myself & irene , \" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at \" mary \" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work . \\nhaving been produced by the same guys who made \" mary , \" \" irene \" seems like an even bigger disappointment . \\nthe brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes . \\nbut they haven\\'t come up with a way to make any of it fresh ; most of \" me , myself & irene \" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy . \\nthe plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who\\'s in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that\\'s entirely predictable from the get-go . \\n ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? \\nyeah , me too . ) \\nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven\\'t already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . \\ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it\\'s no longer funny , merely gross . \\nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . \\ntake , for example , the subplot involving charlie\\'s three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . \\nthe incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . \\nbut by the end of the film , they\\'re still doing the same schitck ; it hasn\\'t been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn\\'t been dropped either . \\nthat\\'s too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . \\n \" me , myself & irene \" reeks of wasted opportunities . \\nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie\\'s new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank\\'s actions . \\nthis doesn\\'t really happen ; nearly every supporting character learns about charlie\\'s condition early on , so they don\\'t have any opportunity to be surprised by it . \\nthe film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , \" whitey \" ) , but the script doesn\\'t go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . \\njim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he\\'s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in \" all of me . \" \\nit\\'s a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . \\ncarrey doesn\\'t pull any stunts we don\\'t expect him to pull , and the farrellys\\' script doesn\\'t give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren\\'t set up in any meaningful way . \\nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . \\nzellweger\\'s irene is not a strong female lead ; mary in \" mary \" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . \\nirene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she\\'s ditzy , clever , or neither . \\nas such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only \" sane \" person in the film . \\nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . \\nhe , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . \\nafter viewing the shapeless mess that \" me , myself & irene \" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . \\nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . \\nbut i don\\'t believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . \\nif the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they\\'ll rebound just fine . \\neven after that happens , though , i\\'ll still consider \" me , myself & irene \" to be a high-caliber misfire . \\n',\n",
       " b\"those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugo's novel les miserables . \\ni don't know if a lot of people have , though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel . \\ni haven't even seen that . \\ngoing into this film , i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters ( i even expected the film to be a musical ) . \\nwalking away from it , i'm kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material . \\nwriter/director bille august's film version is a straightforward , beautifully told film . \\nliam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean ; in the beginning , he has just been released from a 19-year prison sentence . \\nhe is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior . \\nthe priest's words of wisdom influence him , and he makes a vow to change himself . \\nnine years later , we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo ; nobody knows his real name , and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago . \\nconflicts arise when inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is assigned to vigo . \\nvaljean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him , and javert remembers jean to be a convict . \\njavert is hell-bent on upholding the law , and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice . \\nalong the way , valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman , fantine ( uma thurman ) , and vows to take care of her daughter , cosette ( played later by claire danes ) . \\nles miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture . \\nthe production design by anna asp is authentic and vast , and the sets don't look like sets ( they look like real towns and villages ) ; gabriella pescucci's costumes are noticeably spectacular . \\nbasil poledouris' soundtrack is thick and usually well-placed ( though it does get a bit heavy at times ) . \\nmany scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality , such as the climax , which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening . \\naugusts keeps the story simple ( which i hear is a good thing , since the novel is so complex ) and easy to follow . \\nhe manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately . \\ni was also impressed that he didn't go overboard with flash and style , which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days ( such as baz luhrmann's vicious tragedy william shakespeare's romeo + juliet ) . \\nthis film feels solid and whole , and each scene has a certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested . \\nliam neeson is terrific in the main role ; neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well , and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective . \\nthurman , in her small role , is very good , and proves that she has a lot of range and can perform in a very non-glamorous role such as this one . \\nrush is absolutely incredible as javert ; i don't remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here ; he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances , and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense . \\ni can't be as charitable for danes , however ; though i know she is a talented actress , here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit . \\nles miserables is , as i've said , a solid , intelligent motion picture . \\nmy only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy , and perhaps too staged . \\neach scene is grand and huge , and exploding with poledouris' score , but i didn't always want them to be . \\nfor the most part , les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture . \\nit's a good movie , and tells its story well , but august tends to hand-feed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle . \\nhowever , in a film this exciting and well-produced , a few minor flaws are easily overlooked . \\n\",\n",
       " b\"well , as i check my score card for what i've done this holiday weekend , it reads good ideas : 0 and dumb ideas : 1 . \\ni don't know what i was thinking when i decided to watch this movie . \\nbut in my defense , i can only say that it was someone else who urged me to see this with him . \\nthe film that i'm talking about is `a night at the roxbury , ' one of those offerings based on a saturday night live skit . \\nwayne and garth , these two are not . \\nrather , we meet doug and steve butabi ( the actors' names are not worth mentioning ) , two eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions in life seem to be finding a way to get into the hottest night club in the city , the roxbury . \\ndriving in their dad's bmw and donning metallic disco suits right out of miami vice , they try to bribe the bouncer to get into the club . \\n`have you met my friend washington and his friend roosevelt , ' they confidently say as they pull out spare pocket change . \\ntheir second greatest ambition seems to be oozing out as many silly pick-up lines as is humanly possible in order to start a conversation with a girl ( `let me see that label . \\njust as i thought - made in heaven , ' says one of the brothers ) . \\nand , like the losers that they are , they fail to do either for much of the film . \\nhowever , as fate would have it , an accidental meeting with `what-ever-happened-to' richard grieco gives them the all-important ticket to get in . \\ntheir sad lives take on a whole new direction . \\nthey make an important contact with the club owner who believes that these two brothers have uncanny insight into the club scene . \\nand they are mistaken as rich swingers by two voluptuous young women . \\nbut their newfound popularity does not impress their father , who has other plans for them . \\nthe unfortunate thing about this film is that this is a one-joke movie , and the brothers are the joke . \\nactually , there's about 10 mintues worth of tolerable stuff . \\nalas , too long for tv and way too short for a feature-length film . \\nthus , there just isn't enough material to sustain the 83-minute movie . \\nthere's no plot to be found and everything that these two do seem to culminate in an opportunity to execute their trademark move of snapping their heads in unison to the funky beat of haddaway's europop song , what is love . \\ni was amazed that none of the two suffered from whiplash . \\nto take up more film time , there is a subplot involving the daughter of the businessman next door who wants to marry doug . \\nthis creates not only friction between the brothers , but their unlikely pairing will also agitate audience members as well . \\nshe's educated and a forebearing witch . \\nmeanwhile , doug is a complete loser . \\nhow did these two ever get together ? \\ni suppose that if i can ever figure out the answer to that question , i'll have figured out why i decided to go and see this movie . \\nif you're looking for entertainment , you won't find it at the roxbury . \\n\",\n",
       " b'for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking - or what\\'s left of it in mainstream hollywood - movie which are star vehicles are terrible things . \\nas a rule , the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of a particular actor . \\nan actor might be chosen on the up-and-up , to give him exposure ; or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck . \\ngenerally , though , the actor doesn\\'t matter , and soldier , the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers , exemplifies this : the picture lacks pizazz . \\nthe star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell , otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less . \\nrussell plays todd , a human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought . \\nthe movie lets us see this degenerate process , but by the time the real plot starts , we\\'re into todd\\'s later years . \\nhe\\'s about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers , ones who , instead of being trained * from * birth , are genetically selected * before * birth . \\nthe pride of this class - caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) - will be our villain , and you know he\\'s the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movie\\'s start . \\nbetween the two leads , less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken , and it\\'s possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction . \\ndirector paul anderson , who helmed last year\\'s icy thriller , event horizon , doesn\\'t show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam . \\ntodd , upon being replaced , is left to die on a garbage planet ; but in order to stretch the running time out , the villains return to the garbage planet on a \" routine patrol \" and set the stage for the final firefight . \\nevents are predictable from the time that the setups are made , and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here . \\nthe most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be : todd fails to show physical superiority against caine - in fact , not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie - but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry . \\nit\\'s not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story , and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it . \\nthe best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit , and treat it as a parody of typical action fare , like universal soldier . \\na strict interpretation , however , reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style , class , or substance ; and by next year , a large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television . \\n',\n",

       " b'i like movies with albert brooks , and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks . \\nlost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies . \\nhis humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today , inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator . \\nyou will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film , while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent \" talk films \" which are finding their way into theaters . \\nthe situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with , but even if we can\\'t , brooks has the talent to make them comfortable , and therefore we laugh . \\nteenagers and jim carrey fans probably won\\'t find an albert brooks movie very funny , but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will . \\nput simply , brooks\\' comedy is intelligent . \\nmother is albert brooks\\' latest film , and it does not disappoint . \\nbrooks plays john henderson , a middle-aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce . \\nhe makes an attempt at dating , but fails miserably . \\nhe then has dinner with his brother jeff ( rob morrow ) , a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life . \\njeff has a good job , a loving family , and most of all , a warm relationship with their mother beatrice ( debbie reynolds ) . \\nafter dinner , john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice , and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky-dory the dialog is . \\nin comparison , beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him , and john gives it right back to her . \\nat the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john\\'s life , she says , \" i love you , \" and john replies with , \" i know you think you do . \" \\nthe thing is , beatrice is not overt with her criticisms , but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit-picking and guilt loading . \\nit\\'s the kind that goes something like , \" yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but . . . . \" \\nit seems as though nothing he does makes her happy . \\nthere\\'s always the big but . \\njohn believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women , either because of his flawed self-esteem caused by his need for validation , or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner . \\nhe comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is . \\n \" a great experiment \" , he calls it . \\nbrooks\\' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother . \\nthere\\'s a scene where john has just arrived at his mother\\'s house , and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito , and having explained to his mother about the \" great experiment \" , beatrice asks , \" now explain to me again why you don\\'t want to stay at a hotel . \" \\nshe still doesn\\'t get it , and it is absolutely hilarious . \\nin the same scene , we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh . \\nshe apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over . \\nwhen john points out the ice on the sherbet , beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze . \\n \" you\\'ve named the ice ? \" \\nasks john . \\nhe\\'s also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator , such as a twenty-pound block of cheese . \\n \" the freezer was a good invention , \" says john , \" but it\\'s not supposed to be used for everything . \\nthat\\'s why it\\'s smaller than the refrigerator . \" \\nit\\'s something most of us find strangely familiar . \\nbrooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur . \\nfor example , in defending your life , his and meryl streep\\'s characters are in a comedy club having a discussion . \\nwhen they\\'re finished and walk out , brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line , \" and so the moral is , if you have to fart , go outside ! \" \\nyou don\\'t know what the joke was because you couldn\\'t hear him during the entire scene , but i must have laughed for the next five minutes , it seemed so out of context . \\nin this film , brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene . \\ni don\\'t want to give them away , but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past . \\njohn\\'s purpose for staying with his mother is to learn , and we as the audience learn right along with him . \\nhis mother is not the fascinating type to begin with , but as john spends more time with her , we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth . \\nwatching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way . \\non screen , brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character : you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world . \\nin a way , he\\'s very much like yosarian of catch-22 , expect with something of an attitude . \\ncasting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect . \\nshe assumes the part with ease , even moving and speaking a little slowly , and is just so adorable it\\'s hard to get mad at her character . \\nthis only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her . \\nas his first choice , brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice , but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband , who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer\\'s disease . \\nthat may be just as well , since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely . \\nrob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother\\'s favorite and , for all his success in his job and family , is slowly exposed as a mama\\'s boy . \\nthe only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes . \\na solid connection is not really made between john\\'s troubles and his reasons for living with his mother . \\nadditionally , the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals , and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting , how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this ? : \\nbeatrice : you must think i\\'m some kind of moron . \\njohn : no , i think your someone who thinks i\\'m a moron . \\nbeatrice : well , it takes one to know one . \\n',\n",
       " b\"martin scorsese's triumphant adaptation of edith wharton's the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker , the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life . \\nit seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900's , but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder , and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker . \\nthis is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorsese's finest . \\nnewland archer ( day-lewis ) is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland ( ryder ) , a somewhat empty and shallow new yorker , who belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful . \\nthe marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families , in a society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others . \\non the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may , countess ellen olenska ( pfeiffer ) , cousin of may , walks into archer's life . \\narcher is immediately captivated , and finds himself in love with ellen . \\narcher is also bound by the limits of new york society , which is an intrusive as any other in the world . \\narcher finds himself having a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska , attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status . \\nthe film's subject matter may seem alien to scorsese , but the theme is definitely not . \\nit is a theme of forbidden romance , guilty pleasures , and the consequences causes because of those actions . \\nthere is a painstakingly flawed hero , and his choice between the life he wants , and the life he is destined for . \\nin truth , it is a film about a society the audience doesn't know about , but wants to find out more , much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun . \\nthe performances are absolutely breathtaking . \\nday-lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take . \\npfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska , a mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well . \\nryder is probably the gem of the group , for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot , and slowly pushes day-lewis closer and closer to his eventual ending . \\nthe supporting cast is also wonderful , with several characters so singular that they are indelible in one's memory . \\nscorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking . \\nhis lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight . \\nhe literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery . \\nhis script is also excellent , slow in buildup , with a rapid conclusion and a fantastic ending that has to be seen to be believed . \\nit is difficult to make a period piece gripping : scorsese , however , does it beautifully . \\nthe famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere . \\nhe is patient , but he films everything and anything remotely important . \\nthe cameras sweep , pan , track , and do more than they've ever done , but they are so subtle , one doesn't realize he's watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing . \\nthe central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot , but the viewer doesn't notice it , because we want to see more of this gorgeous world . \\nthere are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding , and joanne woodward' narration is exquisite . \\nnot a fast film like goodfellas , this shares more in common with kundun than anything else . \\nand like kundun , this is a slow-starting film that truly shines , when given the chance to fully breathe and bloom in the end . \\na beautiful film by a director continuing to challenge himself year after year . \\n\",\n",

       " b'satirical films usually fall into one of two categories : 1 ) long-term satire where everything , including the jokes , is somehow related on a large scale ( i . e . \\n \" dr . \\nstrangelove \" ; 2 ) situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene ( i . e . \\n \" men in black \" ) . \\nwhat\\'s unique about \" wag the dog \" is that it doesn\\'t necessarily fit either of these descriptions , and yet is both at the same time . \\nthe result is a clever comedy based on an original , smart premise , even if the focus does tend to wander a bit . \\nif there\\'s anything that affects americans the most it\\'s politics and showbusiness . \\nin this age of information and technology , we\\'ve been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things , it\\'s gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it . \\nwe need the media to bring us the most up-to-date news , but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking . \\nthis film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas , and then presents an interesting scenario : if politics , the media coverage of politics , and the entertainment industry are so closely related , couldn\\'t someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all ? \\nthat\\'s the idea conrad brean ( de niro ) , a professional washington spin doctor , comes up with in order to restore the president\\'s good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election . \\nbrean , along with the president\\'s top advisor , winifred ames ( heche ) , fly to california to meet up with hot-shot movie producer stanley motss ( hoffman ) . \\nthey pitch him an idea to \" produce \" the image of a war with albania ( it\\'s a country no one\\'s heard of so they people will buy it ) . \\nsoon the wheels are in motion and the film\\'s riffing satire comes into play . \\nwe\\'re inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation , such as a folk singer , visual and sound effects technicians , and a modern style expert known as the fad king ( leary ) . \\nthe initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv , in the movies , or in the news . \\nthe characters\\' dialogue is witty and funny , although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcom-esque . \\nfor example , one scene shows motss and brean\\'s production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee . \\nmotss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry , but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs . \\nsince it\\'s all computer-enhanced anyway , she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later . \\nthis demonstrates the film\\'s ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise . \\nbut then there\\'s the gags and one-liners that , although are humorous , seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress\\'s name , or , whenever a problem emerges , always responding with , \" this is nothing ! \" \\nby the time the film makes it to the midpoint , everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens . \\nthe first act is quickly paced , while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film . \\nevery ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with , and it\\'s always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it . \\nthe screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems head-on in realistic manners . \\nhowever , it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject . \\nas the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture . \\nwhat had started off as a brilliant , somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie . \\nstill , the situation comedy is quite funny , especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt . \\nwillie schumann - a war hero motss and brean concocted . \\ntruly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time , but think about afterwards and \" wag the dog \" at least succeeds in this respect . \\nhowever , in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done , namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes . \\nthen again , it\\'s a valiant effort . \\n',\n",
       " b'after hearing reviews for woody allen\\'s upteenth movie in history , \" celebrity , \" range from terribly boring to just so-so , my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of \" manhattan , \" my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time . \\nwoody allen\\'s films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair , so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand-in-hand ( \" manhattan \" really is one of the best-looking films i\\'ve ever seen , beautiful black and white photography of the city\\'s best areas , etc . ) , a fan can\\'t help but feel visibly moved . \\nthe film opens up , with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds , and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack , but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky , with the word \" help \" being spelled with an airplane . \\nbeethoven\\'s 5th blasts on the soundtrack . \\nthe city seems to stop to take notice of this moment , and it\\'s all rather lovely to look at . \\nand then we cut to a film crew , shooting this as the film\\'s hilariously banal key moment in the film , where the lead actress in the film ( melanie griffith , looking as buxom and beautiful as ever ) has to realize something\\'s wrong with her life or whatever . \\nit\\'s a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film , with the great opening shots or without , and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again , a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works ( though , for the record , last year\\'s \" deconstructing harry \" came awfully close ) . \\nwhat the hell has happened to him ? \\nthe man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny , but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas . \\n \" bullets over broadway , \" though wonderful , relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off . \\n \" mighty aphrodite \" is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story . \\n \" everyone says i love you \" was more of a great idea than a great film . \\neven \" deconstructing harry \" is admittingly cheap in a way , even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films . \\nif anything , the reception of \" celebrity \" by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time , it\\'s not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is : it\\'s him . \\n \" celebrity \" is , yes , a good film , but it\\'s only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film . \\ninstead of creating the great woody allen world , he\\'s created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about . \\nand he\\'s fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities , so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections . \\nit\\'s like \" la dolce vita \" without the accuracy , the right amount of wit , and the correct personal crisis . \\nwoody , becoming more insecure in his old age , choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities , and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny , and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead . \\nmuch has been said about his performance - dead on but irritating , makes one yearn for the real thing , blah blah blah - but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh\\'s performance , though featuring some of the same mannerisms ( stuttering , whining , lots o\\' hand gestures ) , is hardly a warts-and-all impersonation . \\nbranagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm , which actually allows for his character\\'s flaws to be more apparent . \\nwoody\\'s a flawed guy , and we know it , but we love him anyway , because he\\'s really funny and really witty and really intelligent . \\nbranagh\\'s allen is a bit more flat-out bad , but with the same charm so that , yes , we like him , but we\\'re still not sure if he\\'s really a good person or not . \\nhis character , lee simon , is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie , hits on extra actress winona ryder , then goes off to interview griffith , who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her , and she denies him . . . sorta . \\nwe then learn , through flashbacks , that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a mid-life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion . \\nhe has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts , covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate , so that he can meet them , and maybe sell his script ( a bank robbery movie \" but with a deep personal crisis \" ) . \\nas such , he has divorced his wife of several years ( allen regular judy davis ) , and continues on a quest for sexual happiness , boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film . \\nafter griffith comes his escapades with a model ( charlize theron ) who is \" polymorphously perverse \" ( glad to see allen is using new jokes , ha ha ) , who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of \" la dolce vita . \" \\nfollowing are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen , a relationship that almost assures him success , and his continued escapades with ryder , whom he fancies most of all . \\nhis story is juxtaposed with that of davis , who flips out , but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome , friendly tv exec ( joe mantegna ) who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status . \\nwhile lee is fumbling about , selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness , davis becomes happy ( \" i\\'ve become the kind of woman i\\'ve always hated . . . and \\ni\\'m loving it . \" ) \\nwithout doing a thing . \\nthe result is a film of highs and mediums . \\nthe mediums are what take up most of the film , with sitations and scenes which don\\'t exactly work but you can\\'t help but pat allen on the back for trying . \\nbut other places are really great scenes . \\nthe opening . \\nthe sequence with theron , which is so good that i wished it hadn\\'t ended . \\na banana scene with bebe neuwirth ( droll as ever ) . \\nand , perhaps the best sequence : a romp with hot-as-hell teen idol , brandon darrow , played by none other than leo dicaprio , who is so un-dicaprio-esque that if any of this fans could sit through this film , they\\'d never look at him the same way . \\nhe ignites the screen with intensity , and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical , and totally heartbreaking for lee , who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read , and finds himself on a wild all-day ride with him . \\nthey go to atlantic city to watch a fight , they gamble , and they wind up in his hotel room , where darrow gets it on with his flame ( gretchen mol ) and he lends him one of the leftover groupies . \\nallen\\'s writing in these scenes are so good that just for them , i\\'d almost recommend the film . \\nalmost . \\nbut what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that it\\'s a mess , despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself , it\\'s still a smart and insightful film . \\nthough some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced ( some seem too cartoonish , even for this environment ) , allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities , as it may seem to be ( if it were , it\\'d be extremely out-of-touch ) , but about those who want to be celebrities , and how they equate celebrity-hood with happiness . \\nwe never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if they\\'re really happy ( they may appear to be on the surface . . . ) , but we do get close enough to lee and davis\\' character . \\nlee is obsessed with the phenomenon , while davis takes is at arm\\'s length , and never gets too involved in what it is , and soon becomes one herself . \\nbesides , it\\'s witty , and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allen\\'s : that great woody allen feel . \\nit may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject , and yes , as a part of woody allen\\'s oeuvre , it\\'s merely a blip ( no \" annie hall \" but it\\'s no \" shadows and fog \" either ) , but it goes to prove that no one can make a film like him , and only he and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor , like the one in the beginning , and make it work not once but twice . \\n',\n",
       " b'paul verhoeven , the dutch auteur who dragged his violent , sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film , has never been what i\\'d consider a thoughtful director ( though some of his films , notably starship troopers , have been lauded as artistic achievements ) , but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who\\'s managed to , no matter what the budget , make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils . \\nstarship troopers was essentially a b-monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange ( a great film that\\'s nearly impossible to find on video , yet showgirls is everywhere ) , in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins ; the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards ( who may actually be 45% silicone ) , in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage . \\nit\\'s not a completely successful film , but as a failure it\\'s certainly an interesting ( and mostly entertaining ) one . \\nmy favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores ; spetters , a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange ( haven\\'t yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight ) . \\ni believe his best hollywood film to be robocop , a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic hero that\\'s as touching as schwarzenegger\\'s in t2 . \\nthat movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics . \\nits violence seemed to be there for a purpose , namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread , not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience . \\nthere\\'s a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him . \\nhe tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim\\'s every fearful tic . \\nit\\'s a startling moment of barbaric , maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk-noir . \\nin hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won\\'t shut up , he impales a co-worker , drowns another and so on . \\nbut why ? \\nhis character is introduced as a smug genius , the kind who\\'s always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear , sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place , though once the character becomes invisible , this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster . \\nthe kind who just won\\'t die . \\nhollow man\\'s protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda ( elizabeth shue , acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm ) and her lover , a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who\\'s saddled with the film\\'s worst lines ( \" i\\'ve lost cohesion again ! \" ) . \\nthey\\'re a typical aaron spelling couple , good-looking but as vacant as george w . bush\\'s republican national convention speech ( i . e . \\nbush referring to clinton ; \" ? ? ? so much promise ? ? ? but to what end ? \\nto what end ? \" -- \\nthis actually got applause ! \\nsuddenly warren beatty doesn\\'t look so absurd ) . \\nthe rest of the film\\'s characters are all well past thirty , though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained one-liners ; is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood\\'s new character developing technique ? \\nahh , what a cynical time we live in ? ? ? \\nas the picture opens we meet cain ( kevin bacon ) , an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret ( so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation\\'s ) project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility ( for what purpose is never hinted at ) . \\nthey\\'ve performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine , in a twist worthy of the film\\'s 1950\\'s late show origins , to impulsively experiment on himself . \\ncaine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his co-workers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead . \\nour mad scientist is turned invisible ( after several fx-heavy complications ) , then he inexplicably ( it\\'s hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures , but this is never explored , and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human ? ) \\nbegins raping , assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases , always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger . \\nit grows abundantly clear with each new release that it\\'s verhoeven\\'s films that have become hollow . \\nlike the rest , this one is cold , heartless , and full of contempt for humanity , but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit , insight and makes no statement other than \" audiences will pay for anything these days \" . \\nit\\'s an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level , or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun , thrill-a-minute ride . \\nverhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care . \\nthe previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick . \\nhow can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self ? \\na couple weeks ago , after seeing the trailer , a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability . \\nhollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa , in a serious manner to boot . \\nbut oh yeah , it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway . \\nverhoeven delivers the sleazy \" goods \" , but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner , here it just feels icky and uncomfortable . \\nthe director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses , caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux-psycho music strains in the background . \\nit\\'s plainly obvious that verhoeven isn\\'t exploring voyeurism ( like in the classic peeping tom ) but exploiting it and not even doing that very well . \\nit\\'s funny that with all the technology $90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a woman\\'s naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand . \\nmost vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks . \\nin fact it\\'s largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since , by the end , most of his potential victims don infer-red glasses that track his body heat . \\nas in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov ( a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre ) , and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked . \\nthe film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy . \\nit happens when a lab assistant ( kim dickens , who looks like she stepped out of playboy ) in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon , suddenly pauses . \\n \" are you looking at me ? \" , she queries , obviously haunted . \\nit\\'s a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by 1982 ( the apex of the mad slasher craze ) . \\nthose special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer . \\nand they\\'re the only reason to check out hollow man , preferably as a mid-week bargain rental . \\nyou\\'ve been warned . \\nbut you probably won\\'t listen , will you ?

       " b'the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it\\'s adequately explained by the commercials . \\nwith 11 days to go until the election , the president ( who we never see ) calls in political dirty-tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal . \\ndeniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a \" pageant \" , a phony war against albania , fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville , with woody harrelson as the reluctant , psychotic hero . \\nand if there wasn\\'t anything more to the movie than this , it would be a second-rate heist comedy at best , enlivened by great actors -- like sneakers goes to washington . \\n ( a heist comedy ? \\nyup . \\ndeniro and hoffman are \" stealing \" the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else . ) \\nwag the dog succeeds because it\\'s based one great truth : the american people are stupid . \\nok , maybe it\\'s not \" love thy neighbor as thyself \" or even \" two plus two makes four \" , but a truth nonetheless . \\n ( any average person who thinks that they\\'re really smart about the two things this movie satirizes -- moviemaking and the political process -- is invited , nay , challenged , to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c-span when the house is in session . ) \\nand because we\\'re so utterly , predictably stupid , hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo , washington knows that we won\\'t notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies -- and deniro\\'s character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won\\'t be able to locate albania on the map . \\nthe beauty of wag the dog is that it isn\\'t a light , meaningless comedy about politics ( like speechless , the michael keaton - geena davis picture ) or from the level of light-hearted politcal satire to near-greatness . \\nnor is it a hard-edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally-deprived , ethically challenged baby-boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house ( like primary colors -- and yes , i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out , thanks for asking ) . \\ninstead , david mamet\\'s script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire . \\nit does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers\\' schemes come off beautifully , and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion . \\ndeniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables , without any of the violent rages . \\nit\\'s all : \" what do i love ? \\nwhat is it that brings me joy ? \\nbaseball , \" minus the savage bloody beating with the bat . \\nhe threatens a lot of people , mind you , but he\\'s doing it in a very nice , polite way . \\nit\\'s a very mellow , restrained performance , which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script . \\nhoffman , on the other hand , is giddy , exuberant and joyous . \\nthis kind of thing is what his character lives for , and he\\'s so excited that he can\\'t even shut up . \\neven on the edge of disaster , he\\'s bright-eyed ( behind oddly tinted sunglasses ) and positive . \\ninsiders note that he\\'s basing his character on some powerful-but-anonymous producer -- which may or may not be true , but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets-put-on-a-show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have . \\nthe best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast . \\nthe characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them , listen to them talk in that wised-up mamet dialogue , get to know them better -- which we don\\'t . \\nanne heche , is dead-bang-on in her portrayal of a political press aide -- cool and composed on the outside , panicked and frenzied on the outside . \\ndenis leary ( one of my favorite actors -- see the ref ) is the \" fad king \" , who handles the profitable \" back-end \" -- t-shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative , innovative ways to separate a fool from his money . \\nthey could make a whole movie , just about the fad king , and i\\'d go see it . \\nwillie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously , from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song , to the weepy country waltz , to the hilarious \" ballad of the green berets \" parody . \\nwoody harrelson has a brief , but memorable part as the overmedicated \" hero \" of the albanian conflict . \\ncraig t . nelson , as the opposition candidate , and the ever-reliable william h . macy , as a wacky cia agent , are given surprisingly short shrift . \\n ( one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing . ) \\nwag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems : the trivialization of american politics , the role of the press in dumbing down the issues , the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials , the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars -- the list goes on . \\nwe can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens . \\nwag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don\\'t . \\n',\n",
       " b'when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time . \\nwhile i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good . \\ni\\'m happy to say that there\\'s something about mary is not one of those trailer let-downs . \\nin fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours . \\nthe film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island . \\nted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can\\'t seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w . \\nearl brown ) , who\\'s being harassed by one of the school jocks . \\nit seems warren\\'s sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted\\'s willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up . \\nmary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom . \\nted was just flattered that she even knew his name . \\nunfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital . \\nfast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he hasn\\'t seen since that fateful day . \\nwith the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love . \\nhowever , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections . \\nthere\\'s something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin . \\nnot exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them . \\nwith their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you\\'ll not only enjoy , but also won\\'t mind talking about the next day at the water cooler . \\nthe film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers\\' last two films ) they almost all work . \\ni have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on . \\none minute you\\'ll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you\\'ll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary\\'s apartment . \\none of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller . \\nhe is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he\\'s a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation . \\nted\\'s a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don\\'t always work out . \\nit\\'s comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top . \\nactually , i\\'ve liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid-eighties . \\nthe film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money . \\nin it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big-time bowling hustler . \\nit was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short-lived \" the ben stiller show \" on the fox network in late \\'92/early \\'93 . \\nlike \" the critic \" ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show\\'s cancellation . \\ncameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times . \\nhowever , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she\\'s got guys just falling over each other to be with her . \\nheck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week . \\nmy girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn\\'t change , and you know , it\\'s really true . \\nhe and ralph macchio must hang out or something . \\nmaybe they live in dick clark\\'s pool house . \\nanyway , here\\'s another good piece of casting , as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary\\'s heart . \\nthe supporting performances are also good . \\nchris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy . \\nlin shae , who plays mary\\'s neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji-like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film . \\nlee evans , as mary\\'s friend tucker , displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist . \\nthe farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j . strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren\\'t any noticeable times where the film drags . \\nthe only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes . \\nthey appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot-relevant information right toward the camera . \\nit\\'s a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film . \\nafter that it got a little annoying , and it\\'s unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow . \\nfortunately , filled with sight gags , humorous lines , and solid comedic acting , there\\'s something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater . \\n',\n",
       " b'it should have been a classic . \\na great cast of respected supporting actors . \\nan interesting premise of loser comic book characters . \\nhowever , \" mystery men \" proved to be one of the great disappointments of 1999 . \\nthe jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals . \\nthe number of cliches and shallow characters made the film difficult to sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having a fast paced premise . \\nthe script tried to deliver a series of small jokes throughout the film but without a big laugh-out-loud joke and mediocre small jokes , it failed miserably at being entertaining at all . \\nthe jokes were not funny for a number of reasons . \\nthey had been used a number of times before in previous films , the best ones , which were mediocre to begin with , were ruined in the trailer , and the expectation of laughing at clever , unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none to laugh at greatly damaged the film . \\n \" mystery men \" might have worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying to break into the business . \\nbut with veterans doing this kind of junk , it really questioned whether their other work was as funny as originally thought . \\nthankfully most actors in this movie will appear in five other movies before the new year arrives to help viewers forget this little movie . \\nthe film follows a band of wannabe superheroes living in a wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by their fellow citizens and villains because of their clumsiness and failure to save they day and capture the bad guy . \\nthe fact is these pathetic losers are not needed because their city already has a successful superhero , captain amazing , who has recently captured every evil-doer in the city . \\ncaptain amazing ( played terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear ) , because of his success in the past , is worried that he will lose popularity . \\nafter freeing one of the most notorious bad guys in the city ( geoffrey rush , overacting just a bit too much ) to keep himself busy , things get out of hand when captain amazing is captured . \\nit is up to the wannabe superheroes to save the day . \\nby the time this section of the plot is finished , the interest for what happens ( if you haven\\'t already figured it out ) is very low . \\nthere are very few scenes which catch the viewers complete attention . \\nthe first scene in the film , which shows the wannabes trying to save the day , feels like it was seriously edited down . \\nright when it was beginning to become slightly funny seeing these actors get humiliated at an old folk\\'s home by some masked goons , captain amazing comes in and saves the day ? or ruins the movie . \\ninstead of editing this scene , more editing should have been done in areas such as the unnecessary romance between mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and monica , a waitress ( claire forlani ) or the vast majority of the film , which is the heroes talking at a coffee table about how their day was . \\na simple rule : more silly action is needed in order to make a silly action movie work . \\nanother major problem with \" mystery men \" is that every actor in it seemed very uncomfortable and consequently gave terrible performances . \\nthe film depended on its cast to work fluently together , like a bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion . \\nhowever , most characters seemed like they did not even want to be in this film or at least the script made it seem this way . \\nto pull one of the actors in this film randomly out of a hat , paul reubens , who disappeared from acting to everyone\\'s joy , returns here leaving very little to be impressed about . \\nas a wannabe who uses flatulence for a weapon , all of his jokes must therefore be fart jokes . \\nfart jokes that have all been heard before and will inevitably be heard again in future films thanks to the success of \" american pie \" and \" there\\'s something about mary . \" \\n \" mystery men \" drags on towards the end to a point where anything else in the world is more entertaining . \\nanyone with a brain knows each one of the heroes is going to be successful at their talent in the end and each one is going to contribute in a helpful way . \\nso why continue to watch ? \\nthis film is far from a worthy guilty pleasure . \\n \" mystery men \" indeed does this and every time a character succeeds another one congratulates him and says \" i knew you could do it ! \" \\n \" mystery men \" fails in every category it attempts to pass . \\nwhat makes this film so bad is that it had the potential to be wonderful and unforgettable . \\nterrible acting , terrible script , and a terrible waste of time changes opinions about all of these actors . \\n \" i\\'m unpredictable ! \" \\nan overexcited ben stiller shouts out . \\nno ben , you\\'re the complete opposite . \\n',\n",

       " b'the ads for \" batman and robin \" scream \" the event of the summer is here \" and that\\'s the problem . \\nthe producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it . \\n \" batman and robin \" is 126 minutes of lavish sets , flashy costumes and big , confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance . \\nit\\'s like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows ; bright , busy and visually diverting , but not very much fun . \\nit wasn\\'t always this way . \\ntim burton\\'s \" batman \" was an epic story of obsession and duality , of darkness and revenge . \\nthe film , while far from perfect , was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel . \\nbatman was a creepy , brooding creature of the night . \\nthe joker , brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson , was at once charismatic and repellent . \\nbatman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin , battling inner demons and one another over gotham city\\'s breathtaking gothic skyline . \\nthose days of the dark knight are gone , replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck . \\n \" batman and robin \" has far more in common with the campy 60\\'s batman tv show than with tim burton\\'s tale of darkness . \\nthe blame lies with director joel schumacher . \\na former window-dresser , schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes . \\nunfortunately , when it comes time to have those people walk and talk , he hasn\\'t the faintest notion of what to do . \\n \" batman and robin \" is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it\\'s often difficult to tell who\\'s whacking who . \\nwhile the characters flail at each other , one-liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti . \\na few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing , but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film . \\n \" batman and robin \" doesn\\'t merely lose momentum , it stalls out completely on several occasions . \\nit\\'s rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one . \\nironically , the parts of \" batman and robin \" that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing , and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne . \\neasily the best batman yet , clooney\\'s expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn\\'t even hint at . \\nthe film\\'s most effective scene is a tender , quiet exchange between clooney and alfred ( michael gough ) , bruce wayne\\'s butler and surrogate father . \\nas for the other heroes , chris o\\'donnell\\'s robin is enthusiastic , perky and horny as hell , while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl . \\nin a movie filled to the brim with major characters , the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne\\'s girlfriend is puzzling . \\ni suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built-in nipples , shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight . \\nof course , the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that\\'s where \" batman and robin \" really suffers . \\nas mr . freeze , arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years , spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion . \\nlaboring under a ton of appliances , schwarzenegger looks as if he\\'s having trouble even moving in his suit , let alone trying to act . \\numa thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy . \\nshe overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character ( it\\'s apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain , s/he must be a cartoonish , bumbling nerd ) . \\nonce thurman transforms into the eco-psychotic poison ivy , she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss . \\nthurman fails to maintain the character\\'s maniacal sense of style though , and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film . \\nthe biggest lesson to be learned from \" batman and robin \" is that more is not better . \\njoel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy ; but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is . \\nsome critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam . \\ni don\\'t think so . \\nmy prescription ?

       " b'jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh box-sets on the video shelves -- he had a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the well-off . \\nmaybe it\\'s a classic case of displacement : it\\'s easier to see jarvis\\' own lyrics ( obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall ) as a fetishization of lowlife , rather than leigh\\'s films . \\nbut it\\'s worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of working-class characters don\\'t make for a guarantee of \\'authenticity\\' , let alone a good film . \\nit\\'s the triumph of secrets & lies , then , that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into a probing of just what it means to seek \\'authenticity\\' and honesty in everyday lives . \\nfollowing her adopted mother\\'s funeral , hortense , a young black optometrist , sets out to find her birth mother , and is disturbed to find out that she is white . \\nit is cynthia , a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne . \\ncynthia\\'s younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages , largely because of his wife\\'s animosity towards her . \\nhortense calls up cynthia , who initially breaks down in tears and refuses to see her . \\nbut their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually . \\ncynthia invites hortense to come along to a party , which maurice is hosting . . . \\nsecrets & lies has a simple enough theme at its heart -- as one character puts it , \" best to tell the truth , isn\\'t it ? \\nthat way nobody gets hurt . \" . \\nbut if the film delivers much more than a trite message , it\\'s because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths , even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke us . \\nhence , cynthia\\'s difficulty with acknowledging ( first to herself , then to others ) that hortense is her daughter . \\none of her first reactions to seeing hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever \" been with a black man \" , before a long-suppressed memory seizes her . \\nat the party , cynthia\\'s pretense that hortense is her factory co-worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies , as agonizing as they are funny . \\nlittle lies seep into every corner , like maurice pretending that he\\'s \" just dropping by \" when he visits cynthia after much deliberation . \\nmaurice\\'s job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme - a sad-looking bride that maurice coaxes to smile , a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring and argue about his spectacles . \\none of the most startling images is of a beautiful woman with large scars on her face : she says she needs the photo to look \" as bad as possible \" to collect insurance money , yet the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies behind the scars . \\nthere are occasionally hilarious moments , as when cynthia attempts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception , \" i\\'ve got a dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs \" ; or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs and tells roxanne , \" if you\\'ve got it , flaunt it , is what i say . \" \\nas played by brenda blethyn , cynthia comes close to being a caricature , with her nervous , somewhat disconnected way of talking . \\nbut she\\'s really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her , precisely because she\\'s so needy of love , perhaps . \\nindeed , the whole cast gives warmly rounded , detailed performances . \\nthe script was developed partly through improvisations , and the fusion of cast , script and director shows best in the party scene - seemingly everyone is talking at the same time , and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout . \\nin a very different way , but also using a long single shot , the scene of hortense and cynthia\\'s first meeting in a lonely caf=8a achieves a touching intensity , all the more for their reticence and unspoken feelings . \\nthe film\\'s climax - with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out in ibsen-esque revelations , and everybody hugging each other - is the one thing that seems false about this film . \\nhowever , it\\'s a film that truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the character\\'s lives . \\nwhen cynthia says near the end , this is the life , innit ? , you get the sense that , following the cynicism of his last film naked , leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all , without comforting illusions . \\nthe flying inkpot\\'s rating system : * wait for the video . \\n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \\n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \\n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \\n * * * * * perfection . \\nsee it twice . \\n',\n",

       " b\"in our time . \\nin our modern world , where the cool rule , it's hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming 'the man' . \\nand yet - film after film , after film , is based on his everlasting magic . \\nin warner brothers' latest production , shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat , while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away . \\nthough the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare's 'romeo and juliet' , its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york , is very hard to associate with shakespeare's poetry . \\nthe film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city - the afro americans against the chinese . \\nthe youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered . \\nthe afro-americans are immediately suspected , but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers . \\nit is at this point that han ( the romeo of the story ) finds out about his brother's death . \\nescaping from a prison in china , he returns to united states to avenge his brother's fate . \\nbut before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks , he falls in love with a mysterious beauty . \\nthe only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy . . \\nthere's only a weak echo of shakespeare's talent in this disappointing production . \\nand there are more problems besides its title . \\nof course we don't call it a deformation of a great masterpiece . \\nwe call it 'modernization' . \\nit seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics , without any car chases and gun fights . \\nthis lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing . \\nkenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn't need to be updated , because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature . \\nand as long as love , hate , honesty and corruption do exist , everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare . \\ni must admit that i found 'rome must die' very confusing . \\ni can forgive andrzej bartkowiak , since it is his first attempt at directing . \\nhe manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision . \\nunfortunately he completely forgot about character- and story developments . \\nhis latest picture is therefore visually impressive , but intellectually hollow . \\nthe love story between han ( jet li ) and trish ( aalyah ) , and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified . \\njet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice . \\ntheir achievement save this film from being completely braindead , but they are not actors , and therefore can not act . \\nthey are nothing more than two celebrities put together . \\nthe other actors , including isaiah washington , russell wong , henry o and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances . \\ndelroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality . \\nbut there's more than acting to worry about . \\neven with li's incredible skills in martial arts , the action scenes ( though technically excellent ) are too long and story updates simply embarrassing . \\nto make a long story short : 'romeo must die' is not intelligent enough to be a thriller , not sensual enough to be a love story and too serious to be a fun action film . \\nit is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to 'romeo and juliet' , so the film is completely stuck - not sure of what to be . \\nand in the end it's nothing . \\nthere are no performances worthy of notice , no interesting character- or story surprises . \\nso again , the only good thing about it is its technical achievement . \\nthis film can boast of great sound , fast paced editing , solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences . \\nthe music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre . \\nit is mostly provided by aalyah's enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists , that create a kind of 'ghetto feel' to it . \\nbut when i think back , it's not much i remember from this 'production' . \\nas in almost every summer movie , there are some interesting scenes , but most of the moments that i remember are associated with massive special effects . \\nit is not a film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities , simply because it doesn't have any . \\nfor someone who has never read shakespeare , it's another popcorn film . \\nfor those of us who has , it's a waste of money , time and brain cells . \\n\",\n",
       " b'susan granger\\'s review of \" america\\'s sweethearts \" ( columbia/sony ) \\nwhat a waste of a talented cast ! \\nbilly crystal and co-writer peter tolan have concocted a sly , provocative premise and , as the opening credits roll , it\\'s obvious that they\\'re attempting an old-fashioned romantic comedy . \\nthe story involves a veteran publicist ( billy crystal ) who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director ( christopher walken ) holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room , refusing to show it to anyone . \\nhe figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the film\\'s once-married-but-now-estranged stars , gwen and eddie ( catherine zeta-jones , john cusack ) , they\\'ll be so distracted that they won\\'t remember they didn\\'t see the movie or it wasn\\'t what they expected . \\n ( and crystal thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony critic/david manning quote scandal ! ) \\nfor help , he turns to gwen\\'s personal assistant/sister ( julia roberts ) . \\nbut the laughs are few and far-between . \\ncrystal\\'s glib , cynical flack isn\\'t wickedly funny enough with a few amusing one-liners . \\nafter six months under the care of a depak chopra-like guru ( alan arkin ) , cusack\\'s character\\'s too emotionally fragile , lacking the necessary charisma . \\nzeta-jones\\'s vain , narcissistic diva is undeveloped and one-dimensional . \\nonly hank azaria , as zeta-jones\\'s much-macho spanish lover , and stanley tucci , as a studio exec , and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth . \\nbasically , we don\\'t like these ego-driven , stereotypical characters , let alone root for them to unwind their romantic entanglements , and joe roth\\'s direction is predictable , formulaic and telegraphic . \\non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" america\\'s sweethearts \" is a contrived , shallow 4 . as a screwball satire , it\\'s strictly superficial . \\n',\n",
       " b'the reunion film is not an original idea in any way , shape , or form . \\nit\\'s been done throughout film history over and over again , and has become one of the many sub-genres , like the prep school sub-genre , the angst-filled teen sub-genre , and the slasher sub-genre . \\nwhat makes \" peter\\'s friends \" so remarkable is not how it doesn\\'t follow the rules of this sub-genre , but how it follows it so well , and creates characters that i wouldn\\'t mind hanging with . \\nwhat are the rules of the reunion sub-genre ? \\nwell . . . . \\n1 . you need a group of friends , most of them married or at least dating , and sometimes even married or dating eachother . \\n2 . you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis . \\n3 . they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart . \\n4 . the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10 . \\n5 . they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic . \\n6 . the reunion has to bring them together , seperate them with little crises , then bring them back together because , after all , they\\'re friends . \\n7 . there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited . \\n8 . eightly , they\\'re all unhappy or marginally so . \\n9 . there\\'s some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that\\'s built up over the years . \\n10 . the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts , sometimes internationally so . \\n11 . the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends , sometimes causing them to get together in dance/song . \\nsince it follows these rules so closely , it will probably be ( and has been ) coined off as just a \" british \\'big chill . \\' \" \\nand in some ways it is . \\nboth follow the rules , as i said , and both feature lots of bitching , big confessionals , and broken relationships . \\nbut while \" the big chill \" was , at least to me , a tad too whiny and unsatisfying , \" peter\\'s friends \" hits its mark , making this film funny , dramatic , and poignant . \\nthe friends of peter\\'s were all in the same theatre group back in \\'82 , performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them ( the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus ) . \\nafter peter\\'s ( stephen fry ) wealthy father ( richard briers , hardly on screen enough to register , but oh well ) dies , leaving a giant mansion to him , he has to decide whether or not to keep it . \\nnot sure what to do with it immeadiately , he decides to throw a giant reunion party , inviting back all his old chums . \\nof course , all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule . \\nandrew ( kenneth branagh , also directing here ) is an actor who\\'s unhappily married to a tv star , carol ( co-writer rita rudner ) . \\nmaggie ( emma thompson ) is a successfuly publisher of self-help books , but looks like she needs them more than her customers , as she is lonely and unhappy . \\nroger and mary ( hugh laurie and imelda staunton , who were also married in \" sense and sensibility \" ) are married , and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk , but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died . \\nand sarah ( alphonsia emmanuel ) is as promiscuous as ever , having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian ( tony slattery ) who\\'s married and wants a divorce because of her , giving her doubts . \\nas for peter , things seem okay . . . \\nthe film features lots of inner-friend jokes , and even some old theatre anecdotes ( which i at least find a lot of fun in , as i\\'ve done lots of theatre myself ) . \\nand there are big confessions , brawls between the friends , and by the end , almost everyone is unhappy , even though some have resolved their problems long before the end ( which i kinda dug ) . \\nthe final twist would seem forced an anti-climactic , but for some reason , i felt the same way the rest of the friends did . \\nmaybe it\\'s because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique . \\nthat\\'s really what makes \" peter\\'s friends \" so lovable : the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes , but when someone\\'s in crisis , can come together wonderfully for one another . \\nit\\'s when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends , and these people are true friends . \\nnot to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s ( a decade i grew up in , unfortunately ) without taking us outside of the 90s . \\nthere are some 80s classics and anti-classics like tears for fears \" everybody wants to rule the world , \" but unfortunately no stupid/fun 80s songs ( i think if i ever did an 80s reunion film , i\\'d put some crap go gos song on , or at least some good old \" come on eileen \" ) , but this is the british 80s we\\'re talking about . \\noh well . \\nbut anyway , the direction is pretty good , although nothing amazing . \\nbranagh\\'s forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical , but at least he\\'s very good with making a less ambiguous film like this . \\nthe writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman , with lots of good one-liners , and even some really bad but good puns ( to mock the fact that andrew lives in l . a . , peter , while cutting some logs , asks him is he has wood in l . a . , and andrew says , \" no , but we have hollywood \" - punishment like that ) . \\nthe actors , as in most speaking movies , are better than their material , though , with some stand-out performances to the six friends , as well as the outsiders like slattery , rudner , and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peter\\'s mansion . \\na little note should be made about hugh laurie\\'s performance , as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this - i mean , i\\'ve never seen him actually act this dramatically . \\n \" peter\\'s friends \" is a really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion , although i don\\'t know what kind i\\'ll have ( like most people , i don\\'t look forward to my high school reunion ) . \\nbecause of the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such a long period of seperation , i just look forward to the day when i can have friends like that . \\n',\n",
       " b'synopsis : al simmons , top-notch assasin with a guilty conscience , dies in a fiery explosion and goes to hell . \\nmaking a pact with malebolgia , a chief demon there , simmons returns to earth 5 years later reborn as spawn , a general in hell\\'s army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives , chains , and a morphing cape . \\nsullen , wise cogliostro and flatulating , wisecracking violator vy for spawn\\'s attention . \\ncomments : when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics ( where he had made a name for himself as a first-rate comic book penciller on the \" spider-man \" titles ) to join the newly-formed , creator-owned image comics , a new comic book legend was born : spawn . \\nmcfarlane\\'s \" spawn \" immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s . \\nmcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate , allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max . \\nthe early \" spawn \" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane\\'s genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing . \\nwith the popularity of \" spawn \" and the success of the current warner bros . \\'s batman film franchise , a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn . \\nin the summer of 1997 , hence , new line cinema released spawn , a live-action film based on the groundbreaking series . \\nthis topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book , like me , numbed by how much spawn misses the mark . \\nwhat happened ? \\nwhy is spawn so bad ? \\ntodd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo . \\ni don\\'t think , however , that his presence necessarily hurt ( or helped ) the film . \\ni place the blame , in part , on the recent hollywood trend , fueled by public demand apparently , for special effects blow-out movies utilizing the latest computer technology . \\nthese films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else : character , plot , dialogue , etc . spawn , reflecting this trend , shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics . \\nhardly a minute goes by in this film without fires , explosions , knives and chains appearing out of nowhere , glowing eyes , or constantly transforming demons . \\na lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid , don\\'t get me wrong , but , because the script and cast aren\\'t engaging , spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper ( the surface may capture the eye , but nothing exists underneath ) . \\nspawn\\'s translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level . \\nmcfarlane\\'s spawn was a tortured hero . \\na mercenary by trade , al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda . \\nhaving died and journeyed to hell , he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda . \\nsimmons , however , discovers that his memories are fragmented , his body a creepy mess , and his wife married . \\ndespite his sometimes violent nature , readers couldn\\'t help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld . \\nspawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so . \\nwhen the characters are developed , they seem absurd rather than touching . \\nthe cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot ( a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat-16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world ) do not help matters . \\nspawn , in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman , also unwisely spends too much time on a villain , the violator ( batman favored the joker over batman ) . \\njohn leguizamo , like jack nicholson in batman , receives top billing in the cast as the violator ; michael jai white ( al simmons / spawn ) is second . \\ni ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator . \\nthe film , however , spends so much time on the violator\\'s offensive antics that they grate on the nerves . \\napparently meant to be the comic relief in the film ( as nicholson was in batman ) , especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn , the violator\\'s lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny , leaving the audience wishing he would leave . \\nleguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role , but he is seen far too often in the film . \\nmichael jai white , a relative newcomer to theatrical releases , seems to be an appealing actor , and he handles his role adequately , but we see little of him without various masks on . \\nmore time needed to be spent on white\\'s character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings . \\na special note should be made about martin sheen as the over-the-top , obnoxious , evil general wynn . \\neasily the hammiest performance in the movie , it\\'s hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much ;

       " b'i remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over a year ago , picking up the grand jury prize at the festival . \\n\\'holocaust comedy receives standing ovation\\' , the headlines read . \\nintrigued by this statement , i looked up information on the film and found that , sure enough , life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years . \\neven though the movie was extremely well-received by critics and public alike , i couldn\\'t help but be disgusted at this notion ; human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated . \\nonly now do i see the error of my ways . \\nafter finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time , it became clear that it is not , as the headlines proclaimed , a \" holocaust comedy \" ; on the contrary , life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps . \\nrather , it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son , who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation . \\nroberto benigni ( who also wrote and directed the movie ) stars as guido orefice , a chaplin-inspired clown and all round jolly guy who , as the film opens , is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher ( nicoletta braschi , benigni real life spouse ) . \\nthrough the course of the first hour or so , we see guido striving to get the attention of this \" beautiful princess \" , as he calls her . \\nemploying the magic of laughter , the italian comedian wins her heart and together , they raise a young boy named giosue ( child actor giorgio cantarini ) . \\nlife treats them well until hitler\\'s minions rise to power , and the family is whisked away to a german camp , where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his son\\'s innocence no matter what the sacrifice . \\ngranted , it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp , but it does not pull a \" hogan\\'s heros \" and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews . \\nsomehow , it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it\\'s gravely serious subject . \\nso , we\\'ve established that life is beautiful is not a \" holocaust comedy \" . \\nbut , there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me . \\nthe film , despite critic\\'s declarations of it being a \" triumph of the human spirit \" , is no such thing ; not in my eyes , anyway . \\nsome have called the story an \" affirmation of the beauty of life \" , but i say it is a very dark and bleak statement about man\\'s capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy . \\nthe film\\'s ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently , but i found it to be truly discerning and upsetting . \\nessentially , life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film . \\nhowever , i am not denying the movie\\'s greatness . \\nbelieve me , it\\'s fantastic . \\ni\\'m just saying that i think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as . \\nbut perhaps i\\'m reading more into the movie than is really there . \\nmaybe the film\\'s brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit . \\nin fact , maybe roberto benigni has made a film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of a movie exactly what you put into it . \\n',\n",

       " b'call it touched by a demon . \\ngregory hoblit\\'s fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist . \\nif marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven . \\nin fact , there\\'s even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion\\'s share of the weirdness distilled out . \\n ( remember bob ? ) \\nthe biggest failing of fallen is that , although it\\'s consistently interesting , it\\'s not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . \\na serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice . \\nnow , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , \" what goes around really goes around . \" \\nshortly thereafter , he begins to sing \" time is on my side \" as he\\'s taken on his last walk . \\nminutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead . \\nbut for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn\\'t a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel . \\nand , with reese\\'s death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will . \\nonly hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they\\'re up against . \\nthe rest of the cops , including hobbes\\' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don\\'t have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger . \\nas depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one . \\nno skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . \\nthe most famous landmark to appear isn\\'t the liberty bell or independence hall ; it\\'s geno\\'s steaks . \\nshadows and night scenes abound . \\nthe days are cloudy and unpromising . \\nthis is the kind of setting where it\\'s easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men . \\nfallen\\'s plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized . \\nsomehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . \\nbut the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check . \\nnevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . \\nthe film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . \\nof the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance . \\njohn goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . \\nsadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel . \\neveryone else , including denzel washington , is boring . \\nwashington\\'s flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . \\nit\\'s not that he\\'s bad per se , but he\\'s not very interesting . \\nthere\\'s no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes . \\nas circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . \\nwashington\\'s subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . \\nhowever , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler\\'s list ) and donald sutherland . \\nto be fair , the flaws in their characters aren\\'t all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written . \\nthat said , however , there\\'s nothing inspired about either davidtz\\'s or sutherland\\'s work . \\nboth appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual . \\nnarratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . \\nalthough the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . \\nat times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like \" i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself \" become a little hard to swallow . \\nin addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel . \\nhowever , despite the negatives , i\\'m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved . \\nthe final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected . \\nit\\'s not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did . \\nat a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself . \\nthis is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it\\'s a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours . \\nand , whatever you do , don\\'t walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll . \\n',\n",

       " b'synopsis : captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend a peaceful community of 600 , the ba\\'ku , from the evil admiral dougherty and ru\\'afro . \\nthe enterprise crew , in the meantime , experience the rejuvenating qualities of the ba\\'ku homeworld : lt . worf grows a pimple , data sings opera pieces , picard scores with a ba\\'ku chick , riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi , and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts . \\ncomments : \" star trek : the next generation \" was a hugely successful sequel tv series to \" star trek , \" a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s . \\neven though it still enjoyed high ratings , \" star trek : the next generation \" ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original \" star trek \" \\'s cast in paramount\\'s film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise . \\nstar trek : insurrection is the ninth \" star trek \" movie and the third to focus on the \" star trek : the next generation \" crew . \\nstar trek : insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans , such as myself , would rate somewhere between \" okay \" and \" good . \" \\nafter star trek v : the final frontier , a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant \" star trek : voyager \" tv series , \" star trek \" fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise . \\ni don\\'t wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies . \\nmost people reading this probably haven\\'t followed \" star trek \" anyway , so a comparison would seem tedious at best . \\nlet me , thus , make my comparisons briefly so that it\\'s out of my system : star trek : insurrection is not as good as the previous installment , star trek : first contact ; star trek : insurrection\\'s comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv : the voyage home ; star trek ii : the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie . \\nokay . let\\'s move to the movie itself . \\nstar trek : insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise , humanity\\'s exploration and colonization of space , with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners . \\nthis combination works well more often than it fails , but when it does fail , the humor really seems cheesy . \\nmuch of this film appeals to trek fans\\' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise\\'s crew . \\naudiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times . \\nstar trek : insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba\\'ku homeworld . \\nforget the actors and special effects , the beautiful setting of this movie , with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys , steals the show . \\nthis tranquility , however , is broken by data , an android , who reveals to the ba\\'ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies , the son\\'a . \\nit seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth , sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young , healthy state . \\nthe enterprise crew , led by captain picard , investigates data\\'s actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the son\\'a and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba\\'ku and plunder the planet\\'s youth-restoring properties . \\nsound pretty heavy ? \\nit is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film\\'s constant barrage of humor . \\nwhen going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him ( this is supposed to be cute and humorous ) . \\nin a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba\\'ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , cannot avoid looking at . \\nthe acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good . \\nsince they\\'ve been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough . \\nthe terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean-luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard\\'s trademark , with his usual aplomb . \\nbrent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android-wishing-to-be-human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series ) . \\nthe supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good . \\ndespite many other critics\\' negative opinions , f . murray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ru\\'afro well enough . \\nru\\'afro reminds me , somewhat , of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune . \\nlike the baron , ru\\'afro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants . \\nin one particularly memorable scene , ru\\'afro becomes very agitated , and his facial skin splits open and bleeds . \\nru\\'afro is no khan from star trek ii--the best trek villain ever--but he is much better than the forgettable dr . soran from star trek : generations . \\n ( okay , i promise , no more comparisons . ) \\ndonna murphy must also be noted as a ba\\'ku woman , anij , who picard falls in love with . \\nmurphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body ; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance . \\nthis is the type of woman whom picard , for those who know the character well , would be enchanted with . \\nin fact , the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here . \\na particular plot point involving anij\\'s ability to slow time down , an ability which she shares with picard , becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie . \\nfor as good as the actors and setting were , star trek : insurrection\\'s special effects were surprisingly disappointing . \\nthey proved adequate , sometimes barely , for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film , but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars : the phantom menace ( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection ) . \\nthe space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships , in particular , seemed trite and unsuspenseful , and the final confrontation between picard and ru\\'afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite . \\nthe new enterprise itself , only seen in this film and its predecessor , remains largely unexplored , though its exterior doesn\\'t look quite right for a reason i cannot explain . \\ndespite star trek : insurrection\\'s frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects , i enjoyed the film . \\nit maintains roddenberry\\'s largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors , particularly star trek : first contact ( though , don\\'t get me wrong , the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully ) . \\ni\\'d recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon , especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general . \\nrated pg , i can\\'t see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience , young or old . \\n',\n",

       " b'like the wonderful 1990 drama , \" awakenings , \" starring robin williams and robert de niro , \" at first sight , \" directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physicfirst sight , \" directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physician oliver sacks . \\nsince \" awakenings \" was so very good , and made my top ten list the year it was released , \" at first sight \" is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall , but is still an intelligent and vibrantly-acted drama . \\nthe film begins as amy ( mira sorvino ) , a stressed-out new york architect , decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country . \\nat the hotel she is staying at , she makes a massage appointment and after a long , soothing session which ends with her crying as a release of emotions , she strikes up a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil ( val kilmer ) , only to find out later that he is actually blind . \\namy doesn\\'t really care if he has a handicap or not , and begins to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love . \\nonce she has returned to new york , amy begins to research on virgil\\'s certain type of retinal blindness , which he has had since three years of age , and out of a stroke of luck , comes into contact with a doctor ( bruce davison ) who believes he can repair virgil\\'s sight , even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history . \\nat first reluctant , virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery , much to the hesitance of his overbearing , but loving older sister ( kelly mcgillis ) . \\nultimately , the surgery is a success , but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees , since he has never visually seen anything before , only touched objects . \\nhe moves into amy\\'s apartment and she is eager to stand by him , but virgil\\'s maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship . \\non the basis of the overall story , \" at first sight \" is indeed a film that has been done many times before , and owes a great deal to its predecessor , \" awakenings . \" \\nwhat will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance . \\nhowever , what helps \" at first sight \" rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy . \\nusually , romantic pictures are of the shameless puppy-dog sort ( the recent tom hanks/meg ryan-starrer \" you\\'ve got mail \" immediately pops to mind ) , but with this film , i grew to care more about the characters and their plight . \\nthe film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil . \\nthe massaging sequences were strangely erotic , maybe even more so than the later actual \" love scenes , \" and as their romantic involvement quickly developed , the film was both entertaining and sweet , and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two . \\nthese joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known , with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting , peaceful life in the country to amy\\'s eventful life in the \" big city . \" \\nthe other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board . \\nval kilmer , usually cast in the \" macho \" type of role , was always believable as a blind person , and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears . \\nit was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity , but to sympathize with , and he pulled it off . \\nmira sorvino , who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995\\'s hilarious woody allen comedy , \" mighty aphrodite , \" for which she won a well-deserved oscar as a kind-hearted , but ditzy hooker , is a standout here . \\nalthough she has made some mediocre film choices since then ( 1997\\'s \" mimic , \" 1998\\'s \" the replacement killers \" ) , she always has managed to come out unscathed , and it is with \" at first sight \" that she finally has another juicy role to play . \\nin a truthful climactic scene set in amy\\'s apartment between she and virgil , sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today , and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces . \\nkelly mcgillis , who could have easily come off as the \" bad , \" one-dimensional sister , instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother . \\nfinally , nathan lane , who is usually a little too over-the-top , is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist . \\nthe one misstep of \" at first sight \" is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil . \\nvery little is ever said or discussed concerning it , and when the surgery occurs , it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes . \\nperhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in-depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences , but i would personally take realism , even if it is graphic , any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder . \\nin \" awakenings , \" the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed . \\nbecause of how strong the screenplay , written by steve levitt , is in the way it deals with the main relationship , and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino , the film\\'s few problems can be swept over to the side . \\nthe adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is , no doubt , in respect to the real-life couple that the film was inspired by , who are still together after many years ( even though the setting of the film was changed to new york ) . \\nsince january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies , \" at first sight \" comes as a refreshing and sophisticated change of pace . \\n',\n",

       " b'it\\'s always a bad sign when the core audience of a film -- children -- are either walking out early or are half-asleep when the credits roll at the end of a film . \\nthat about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians , a cold pea soup of cute animals , stupid home alone antics , a boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans , and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression . \\nindeed , walt disney is rolling over in his grave again , cursing john hughes\\' name for making the original live-action 101 dalmatians , one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time , and now its sequel . \\nthe main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor , 101 dalmatians . \\nthe original made more than $100 million dollars at the box office , spawned a torrid collection of \" collectible \" items that ended up months later in the discount bins of wal-marts across the country , and generally made every kid on the planet want a damn dalmatian pup for christmas . \\nwell , it\\'s been about four years since then , and dalmatian fever is coming back , and this time it\\'s digitally enhanced . \\nhere\\'s the story . \\ncruella de vil ( glenn close ) is released from prison due to the \" cure \" of her puppy homicide urges by one dr . pavlov . \\n ( oh , how witty . ) \\nshe rejoins the world as a dog lover and is assigned to a probation officer , who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film . \\ncruella then becomes ella -- dog lover -- until the plot twists , like a dog with his leash caught on the back of a moving truck , and she becomes the evil vixen again . \\na kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat , but she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 dalmatian formula . \\nat this point , i was envying those kids filing out of the theater . \\nhow low have glenn close and gerard depardieu ( as the film\\'s villain ) sunk in the film business ? \\nit\\'s almost laughable in a sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardrobe of flash gordon . \\nand depardieu . . . \\nhow can a french guy have a bad french accent ? \\nand never mind the toilet brush haircut . \\nthe only minutely positive selling point i can even think to point out is the talking bird with a british accent ( courtesy of eric idle ) that thinks he\\'s a rottweiler . \\nnow that\\'s funny . \\n',\n",
       " b\"not since 1996's shine , which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott , has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of world-class musicians . \\nin fact , if one were to watch these films together , it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills . \\nyet hilary and jackie , the sophomore effort from director anand tucker , has something more to say -- it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in a very compelling tale . \\nemily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale , playing the sisters du pr ? . \\nboth musicians from childhood , hilary ( griffiths ) is renowned flutist while jacqueline ( watson ) is easily as skilled on the cello . \\nthe two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women , both together and seperate . \\ntheir careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one another's , and although their lives take very different paths -- hilary settles down to marriage and a family while rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour -- they are bound together by their deep family love . \\nthe performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance . \\nthey contrast each other wonderfully , and while watson's portrayal of jackie du pr ? is at times eccentric and perhaps unsympathetic , both characters are charged with emotion . \\nthe frank cottrell boyce script , which is based on the book by hilary and piers du pr ? , brings a great deal of depth to these characters as well . \\nthe script is also to be commended for its well-polished dual nature . \\ncottrell boyce adopts a style which one might expect to see in a mystery thriller ( which was in fact the case with david koepp and robert towne's script for mission : impossible ) and skillfully molds it to the story of two rising musicians on different courses to fame . \\nthe latter parts of his script are controversial to say the least , and the rather depressing ending takes the wind out of an envigorating story . \\nsome will leave this movie feeling disenfranchised . \\nnevertheless , hilary and jackie is a movie that reaches an upper echelon of contemporary cinema through solid fundamentals and is a decent watch all around . \\n\",\n",
       " b\"in some respects , rush hour is the ultimate exercise in cliched filmmaking . \\nthe hero is the renegade cop that prefers to work alone . \\nthe cop in question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble . \\nall chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element . \\nthe duo must always be completely mismatched . \\nthe hero has to say some smart-assed comment before ( and after ) shooting someone . \\nhowever , that doesn't necessarily make for a bad film . \\nrush hour is jackie chan's first major hollywood film since the dismal the protector ( 1985 ) . \\nproving once again that hollywood can learn many things from foreign film markets ( ie : hong kong ) , jackie chan is given much more free reign than before . \\nstill , some die-hard jackie chan fans may be disappointed , as even chan himself has voiced displeasure over the length of the fight scenes ( which he views as too short , according to one interview ) . \\nthis film takes a familiar theme of east meets west . \\njackie chan is lee , the straight laced inspector who is imported to help deal with a kidnapping case , while chris tucker is carter , the loudmouthed , destructive cop that is `promoted' to the fbi to help him . \\nor , at least , so he thinks ( also another classic notion in action films : the fbi must always get in the way of our heroes ) . \\ndespite the necessary conventions of action films , rush hour is some of the most fun you'll spend and hour and forty minutes watching . \\njackie chan continues to be one of the most exciting martial artists on the big screen , continuing to perform his own stunts and dazzling audiences with his flashy kicks and punches . \\nchris tucker , familiar from his whiny , annoying role in the fifth element is more palatable , complementing jackie chan's straight-laced character . \\nhowever , jackie chan still maintains his comic-slapstick edge , as expected of him and his films . \\nperfectly downplaying the `fish-out-of-water' routine through his character's attempts at mixing into american culture , he makes up for the down time his character experiences . \\nwhen he is in action , however , you'll be amused and dazzled . \\nstill being inventive in the use of objects to beat people up ( in this case , a steering wheel , a serving tray , and a barstool ) , jackie chan proves to be the pioneer of slapstick kung fu . \\nchris tucker's character may come across as irritating , yet is also humorous . \\nsince he's not a physical actor to the level of jackie chan , he uses his main weapon : his mouth ( hence , the tagline , `fastest hands in the east meets the fastest mouth in the west' ) . \\nwhile dialogue is not necessarily shakespeare , it is appropriate for the film and still very funny . \\nwhile not necessarily poignant , attempts at character development and growth between characters come off surprisingly well . \\nlee's `knowledge' of american pop culture ( `that's the beach boys ! ' ) \\nwhen contrasted against carter's lack of knowledge of chinese culture makes for an interesting scene where lee teaches carter the kung fu disarming trick , while carter teaches lee hip-hop dance moves . \\nwhile rush hour is not at the same level as police story 3 and 4 ( known in north america as supercop and jackie chan's first strike , respectively ) , it more than makes up for the poorly received films operation condor and mr . nice guy . \\nwith its appropriate mixture of high kicks and lots of laughs , it makes for a fun film . \\nas well , it is a true departure from jackie chan films , as it is missing one common element : a whiny female co-star . \\n\",\n",
       " b'when a pair of films from the same director gets released just three weeks apart , it could mean one of two things : that the recently overworked individual is due for a well-deserved rest , or that either of these movies has been sitting in a studio safe for a while and the timing is merely a coincidence . \\nthe latter\\'s the case with john mctiernan and \" the thirteenth warrior , \" which finally hits theatres a year and counting after its original spring \\'98 opening - and fast on the heels of mctiernan\\'s \" the thomas crown affair \" remake , a flick that got good reviews . \\nyou don\\'t have to believe superstitions to wager a guess that \" thirteenth \" won\\'t be so lucky . \\nreportedly shelved following skirmishes between mctiernan and producer michael crichton , whose \" eaters of the dead \" novel provides \" warrior \" \\'s source ( and its initial title ) , this messy melange of culture-clash drama and brutal warfare feels empty and sluggish - sorta like \" braveheart \" without any of the passion . \\nbut the bloodshed certainly remains : there\\'s enough carnage on display here to satisfy those in search of purely visceral thrills , though please note that the admittedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death and dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable in their dullness . \\nthese circa-10th century clashes involve a roving band of cannibalistic creatures capable of decapitating opponents with their bare hands and a dozen norse soldiers out to stop them from terrorizing the viking countryside . \\nthe good guys are loud , crude , often unintelligible and - judging from their highly icky hygiene habits -- pretty smelly to boot , which makes them perfect foils for the dignified arab ambassador ( antonio banderas ) who tags along quite reluctantly . \\nthey\\'re also so hard to tell apart that it hardly matters when a few of them meet violent demises . \\nyou\\'ll wince , you\\'ll groan , you\\'ll grouse , \" haven\\'t we seen this guy killed twice before ? \" \\nbanderas stands confused amidst the chaos , partaking mostly from a distance as savages in darth maul facepaint and draped in the latest animal-skin fashion run amok . \\nhe\\'s not the hero - his soulful eyes and lean build don\\'t exactly herald a champion of shwarzenegger proportions - and \" the thirteenth warrior \" wisely doesn\\'t pretend he is , allowing his foreign and physically imposing co-stars to step into the spotlight when the going gets rough . \\nlet the characters interaction sans swords and shields , however , and there\\'s still a struggle - for the audience to follow or even care about the story . \\nit isn\\'t the end until audiences have witnessed a half-baked romance , murky political intrigue , veteran actor omar sharif ( \" funny girl \" ) dropping by in a cameo role and a climactic \" indiana jones and the temple of doom \" -esque chase through the villains\\' underground lair . \\nall this clutter receives stunning visual treatment courtesy of cinematographer peter menzies jr . , but the collaboration between \" die hard \" -helmer mctiernan and \" jurrasic park \" -creator crichton should have yielded more than sumptuous sights , graphic action and unintentionally telling moments . \\nheard during \" the thirteenth warrior \" \\'s final scene : a dog whimpering . \\nhow appropriate . \\n',\n",
       " b'it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus when i persuaded a friend to see a matinee performance of mst3k : tm . \\nhe had never seen any episodes of the show , and i have watched a scant few , due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes . \\nfor those of you not familiar with the premise , dr clayton forrester ( beaulieu ) wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public . \\nto achieve this , he ( in the words of the tv series\\' theme , which is missing in the movie ) \" bumped [mike nelson ( nelson ) ] on the noggin and then shot him into space \" , and is monitoring nelson\\'s reactions to the movies he is forced to endure . \\nrather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies , nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions , tom servo and crow t . robot . \\nthe format of the show consists of nelson , servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched , and breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love , the ship on which our heroes are marooned . \\nonly two things are different in the movie : the absence of forrester\\'s sidekick , tv\\'s frank , and the slower pace of the jokes . \\nthis latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke . \\nfor their big screen outing , the producers have chosen \" this island earth \" , a 1954 classic , and one of the first sf films to have a special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill . \\nunfortunately for that film ( but making it ideal mst3k fodder ) , acting and dialogue appear to have taken a back seat to the effects which , by today\\'s standards , are less than impressive . \\nnelson & co . make jokes about everything from japan\\'s dominance in the world market , to star trek , to the state of disrepair of seattle\\'s kingdome , and most of them work . \\nunfortunately , the segments set outside the satellite\\'s movie theater seem out of place and aren\\'t particularly funny , but at least they\\'re fairly short . \\nthe big question about this movie though is : why ? \\ni presume it was an attempt to gain a larger following to keep support behind the series ( rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled a few months ago ) , but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen -- there are no special effects to dazzle you , no action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat , and no use of digital surround sound . \\nso , it seems pointless to spend $8 per person to see this movie when in a few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for $3 , and not have to sit in a room full of popcorn addicts . \\nnevertheless , mst3k : tm provides more laugh-out-loud opportunities than any film you\\'re going to see this year , and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a pulse . \\ngiven its uniqueness , i hesitate to grade it against other films , but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of \" unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad b-movies \" it does well . \\n',\n",

       " b\"it's been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast . \\nsure , there have been delightful outings like last years hercules . \\nbut nothing entirely groundbreaking . \\nwith the release of the studio's newest feature length film , a remake of edgar rice burrough's creation tarzan , disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques . \\nit's no classic , but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be . \\nthe plot is loyal to the original storyline , as tarzan's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire , and find shelter in the jungles of africa . \\nbut , they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor , leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib . \\nfound by kala ( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close ) , a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack , tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own . \\nwe follow the young boy through the years , as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk ( a very brash but funny rosie o'donnell ) and clumsy elephant tantor ( wayne knight ) . \\nof course , in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero . \\nin tarzan , these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously . \\ngags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here . \\nmost of the characters are amusing without being forced . \\nas tarzan grows to manhood , the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture . \\nhere , the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , who's accompanying a hapless professor ( nigel hawthorne ) on an expedition through the jungle . \\nof course , there's the professor's daughter , jane ( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver ) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie . \\nthe thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation . \\ndirectors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3-d element to the movement of the athletic title character , and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel . \\nas tarzan carries jane through the treetops , narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons , he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave . \\nyour eyes can barely keep up ; it's a fantastic accomplishment . \\nthe subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average . \\nthere are important questions raised about tarzan's place in the world , and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters . \\nthere is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward , which is a surprising plus that i wasn't expecting to find here . \\nsuffice to say , this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained . \\nthe grown-up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn , who made a name for himself as the `big mean jerk' from ghost . \\ngoldwyn is effective playing someone who's not aware of his world's dangers . \\nglenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother , and lance henriksen ( from tv's millennium ) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child . \\nas the movie's villain , there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton . \\nit helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm , but he is nothing compared to james woods' hilarious hades from hercules . \\na burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence . \\nstill , this is one great thrill-ride that disney has constructed . \\ni never expected rice burrough's work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation , nor with so much emotional depth . \\nparents , along with all the kiddies , are going to find much to like in tarzan . \\n\",\n",

       " b'i had an epiphany today . \\nit occurred to me while i was watching \" house on haunted hill . \" \\nit is as follows : if a trailer makes the film it\\'s advertising look like a trashy , stupid movie , well guess what ? \\nchances are , there * is * truth in advertising . \\ntoo bad i didn\\'t trust my own instincts when something-or-the-other possessed me to see this movie . \\ni blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of \" sleepy hollow . \" \\nthat and \" dogma \" started too late in the afternoon for my schedule . \\nan hour of \" angel \" or \" buffy \" is scarier than this doozy that tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face . \\ni wish i\\'d seen it when it was halloween . \\nat least i would have been forgiving . \\nhey , tis the season . \\nthe movie was scary ( albeit very confusing , dizzying , and nauseating ) at first , but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously wasn\\'t going anywhere . \\nnow i truly appreciate films like \" scream , \" \" halloween , \" or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic . \\nthat\\'s what spooks people out , the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know . \\nthere has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with . \\nsure , utterly unpredictable is good , too , but that\\'s different from utterly nonsensical . \\nhohh ( house on haunted hill ) , on the other hand . \\n . \\n . \\nwell let\\'s just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they oh-so-cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago . \\nriiiiight . \\ny\\'know , that just sends chills down my spine . \\nyeah . \\njust like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil . \\nooooooo . \\nhint : blood and guts only work a few times . \\nsooner or later people start to tell themselves that it\\'s just ketchup and props and you\\'ve got to come up with something better than that . \\nthere were just too many things in this movie that we\\'ve all seen before ; from the inevitable \" plot developments \" of strangers unwittingly trapped together ; strangers turning against each other ; the evil manifesting itself ; the dead coming back for a last scare . \\neach was more predictable than the last . \\nwhy didn\\'t these fools just stay together in one place anyways ? \\nsheesh . \\nwas i grossed out ? \\nyes . \\ndid i get spooked a few times ? \\nyes . \\nbut why ? \\ni get really disturbed when there is no why . \\nwhen there weren\\'t random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect ( which wasn\\'t that good either , trust me ) and the scare , the film was filled with drab , laughable dialogue . \\nthe characters were incredibly flat and cliched . \\nnot to mention downright annoying . \\nyou\\'ve got a bunch of people going nowhere in their lives ; of course they\\'re dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night . \\njeez , i thought no one fell for those \" you may already be a winner \" things anymore . \\nand of course , all three gals are babes . \\ni wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of \" shine \" ended up in this movie . \\nkeep that up , geoff , and you\\'ll qualify for the next batman venture . \\nthe only single person i enjoyed was chris kattan because , well , he just cracks me up . \\nand famke jansen ( sp ? ) \\nbecause she reminds me of the delectable brosnan . \\npierce brosnan ( hey , i willingly endured \" dante\\'s peak \" three times for him : ) . \\nall right , i concede . \\nthere were a couple of things i enjoyed . \\nthat perverted little amusement park at the beginning . \\ni probably won\\'t ride a rollercoaster for a while . \\nand the machine they used to drive geoffrey\\'s character mad ( see , i don\\'t even remember their names ) . \\nthe machine , not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it . \\ni kept waiting and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end of the movie . \\nit wouldn\\'t have redeemed the film , but at least it would have made me feel better . \\nbut no , they opted for the beautiful sunrise ending . \\nthank god they didn\\'t add a kiss at the end or i would have puked . \\ngod , there is no hope . \\n',\n",
       " b'it\\'s terribly unfortunate that \" stir of echoes , \" tautly written and directed by david koepp ( who made one of 1996\\'s unsung treasures , \" the trigger effect \" ) , should be released little more than a month after \" the sixth sense , \" which is still going strong at the box office . \\nthese two films are undoubtedly going to be compared ( judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night ) , and although they have eerily similar storylines , \" stir of echoes \" is more of a straightforward psychological horror film , while \" the sixth sense \" is closer to a psychological drama . \\nadditionally , while \" the sixth sense \" had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business , \" stir of echoes \" is more conventional and predictable in its final twist . \\nand where \" the sixth sense \" was disturbing , \" stir of echoes \" is just plain scary . \\ni have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities , and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits . \\nadapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago , \" stir of echoes \" opens with a cute six-year-old boy named jake ( zachary david cope ) who is taking a bath . \\nhe is speaking directly at the screen , but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there . \\nfinally , he asks , \" does it hurt to be dead ? \" \\napparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people , but unlike \" the sixth sense , \" this young child isn\\'t the focus of the picture . \\ninstead , tom witzy ( kevin bacon ) , a chicago lineman , is our protagonist . \\njake is his son , and maggie ( kathryn erbe ) , whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant , is his hard-working wife . \\none night while at a party with their closest friends , tom convinces maggie\\'s new-age sister , lisa ( illena douglas ) , to try and hypnotize him . \\nit unexpectedly works , and before long , tom is seeing things he wouldn\\'t normally see , including a deceased teenage girl ( jenny morrison ) in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months . \\nseeking help from lisa , she tells him that , while he was under hypnosis , she told him that after he awoke , his mind will remain clear and free , like an opened door . \\nshe didn\\'t expect it to work , but it did , and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees . \\n \" stir of echoes \" isn\\'t a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination , but in the thick , atmospheric mood it conjures up , it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror-drama , and is not only effective on a technical level , but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working-class family . \\nkevin bacon and , especially , kathryn erbe ( 1997\\'s \" dream with the fishes \" ) , are top-notch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems . \\nafter tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions , he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house , and instead of maggie not being understanding , she instead believes what tom says , and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through , does not try to stop his pursuit . \\nbacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts , and therefore , are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet . \\nin a masterfully-done , entrancing sequence , tom is hypnotized by lisa , but instead of watching him , we instead see what he sees , starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness . \\nlisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater , and so , we , as audience members , are watching a movie screen from inside a theater , which is also showing a movie screen in a theater . \\ntelling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen , we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is \" sleep . \" \\nnever before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly-construed as this one . \\ntruthfully , this set-piece , and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt , are worth the full price of admission alone , just to see them on the big screen . \\nhaving loads of fun with her small role as maggie\\'s sister , lisa , illeana douglas ( 1995\\'s \" to die for , \" her last great character ) is a delight , but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films . \\nfunny and enjoyably offbeat , douglas gets to utter the best line in the film : while talking to maggie about tom\\'s visions of the girl , she remarks , \" i wouldn\\'t be worried about him seeing another girl , although the fact that she\\'s dead gives one pause . \" \\nalso of note are jenny morrison ( 1994\\'s \" intersection \" ) , who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character , and liza weil , remarkable in 1998\\'s \" whatever , \" as morrison\\'s grieving teenage sister , debbie . \\nif the resolution of \" stir of echoes \" does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential ( and it doesn\\'t ) , what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty . \\nthe music score , by james newton howard , and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects , successfully compliment and foreshadow the off-kilter frame-of-mind that tom is put into , and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically-written characters . \\n \" stir of echoes \" isn\\'t as good as \" the sixth sense , \" but why should it need to be ? \\nboth films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet , and \" stir of echoes \" really is a spinetinglingly good horror film . \\n',\n",

       " b'in roger michell\\'s romantic comedy notting hill , william thacker ( hugh grant ) leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it\\'s name to the film\\'s title . \\none day , american movie superstar anna scott ( julia roberts ) walks in to purchase a book on turkey . \\nquickly enamored of each other , the two embark upon an on-again , off-again love affair replete with romance , humor , and the occasional lump in the throat . \\nthe film opens with a non-verbal cue to anna\\'s stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress\\'s appearances in films and at premieres - coming out of limousines , walking the red carpets and such . \\nwithout words , this sequence gives us a background to her character . \\nfollowing , however , is a set-up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives . \\ni don\\'t know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn\\'t have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie\\'s beginning , but there it is . \\nif there were ever a clear case for \" less is more , \" this would be it . \\nthe film is told nearly first person from william\\'s point of view , as he is in every scene . \\nby nature of this arrangement , we get a very definite sense of what he is all about , and his nice guy personality wins us over easily . \\nin fact , much of notting hill\\'s strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis . \\na scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he\\'s even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey-soaked apricots from his refrigerator . \\nor take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image . \\nwilliam assures her he wouldn\\'t say a word , then adds , \" well , i\\'ll probably tell myself now and then , but i\\'d never believe it . \" \\ngreat stuff . \\nthe downside to spending so much time with william is that we don\\'t get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible . \\nwe\\'re constantly exposed to william\\'s thoughts , feelings , actions and desires , but don\\'t actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him . \\nthere are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest , but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we\\'re not sure what she\\'s been thinking all the times in between . \\nthis , combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two , makes this hugh grant\\'s film hands down . \\nhe gets the great scenes ( look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna ) , the great lines , and gives an overall wonderful performance . \\njulia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress\\'s top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ( ala sandra bullock in a time to kill ) along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character\\'s unpredictable behavior . \\nanna doesn\\'t get a lot of our compassion . \\nthis romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance , much of it supplied by grant himself , but with considerable help from the supporting cast . \\nmost notable is rhys ifans as spike , william\\'s eccentric roommate , who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh . \\nhugh bonneville , emma chambers , james dreyfus , and gina mckee bring up the guard as william\\'s friends and family , particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister\\'s birthday dinner , and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst . \\nit\\'s a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation . \\nroger michell\\'s use of visuals doesn\\'t sweep us off our feet , but does give us more than your typical movie of this type . \\nfor example , there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass . \\nwhereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying \" eight months later , \" michell presents us with more interesting cues , such as william\\'s walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him . \\nanother memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air . \\nwe\\'re generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so , but in this case , the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird\\'s eye view of the ground below . \\nmusic is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film\\'s scenes , and some of this might have been better toned down , but in other areas it works to full effect . \\nit\\'s kind of a mixed bag , but still fares better than many of today\\'s lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video . \\nat least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate . \\nnotting hill\\'s grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all-time greatest film pairings , but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it . \\nfor a couple of hours , you should expect to laugh more than cry , and that\\'s not so bad , now is it ? \\n',\n",
       " b'a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings . \\nfamily breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years , and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand-wringing detail . \\nstill , i can\\'t recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love . \\nand after it , i still can\\'t . \\nbye bye love is rarely funny , more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tv-movie fare . \\nonly a few moments which have nothing to do with the film\\'s main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion . \\nbye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children . \\ndave ( matthew modine ) , a father of two , is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend ; vic ( randy quaid ) is a foul-humored father of three about to go on a rare date ; donny ( paul reiser ) pines for his ex-wife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma ( eliza dushku ) . \\nover the course of the weekend , the three men face various crises , including vic\\'s blind date from hell ( janeane garofolo ) and donny\\'s growing estrangement from emma . \\nthe three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo , and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality . \\nrandy quaid is the best of the three , bitter without being irritating , gleefully spiteful without being frightening . \\nhis run-ins with is ex-wife ( lindsey crouse ) are a bit over-played , though , and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist ( rob reiner ) is gimmicky and implausible . \\nhe does get bye bye love\\'s best sub-plot , a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo , and he does a great slow burn . \\npaul reiser really has only one character , his slightly befuddled , uptight nice guy \" mad about you \" persona , but he does it well . \\nas a personality , he is appealing , but as a character , he becomes pretty boring here . \\nmatthew modine , is , quite simply , terrible . \\nthis isn\\'t a performance good enough to be called mailed-in ; he even forgot to put a stamp on it . \\nmodine lacks any charm in an appallingly under-written role , looks bored most of the time , and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how it\\'s all his father\\'s fault he\\'s such a cad . \\ncarolco\\'s executives , whose entire future is resting on modine\\'s bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island , must be sweating buckets right now . \\nbye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie , because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids , making it just another \" dating in the 90s \" movie . \\nwhen the movie does deal with the children at all , it is to have one of them scream out an accusation and/or cry , perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug , perhaps not . \\neven more confusing is a sub-plot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work and a mcdonald\\'s and befriends a troubled youth . \\nit is a sad end to flanders\\' career , getting caught up in a truly annoying over-use of mcdonald\\'s as a location , a plot device and , apparently , a major advertiser . \\neven if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parent-child relationships , it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off , because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family break-ups and their effects on children . \\nany way you slice it , it is a bad situation for kids , and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue . \\nit is left to the dads\\' romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is , and it isn\\'t enough . \\nthere have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood , but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching . \\nbye bye love is a genuine shame . \\n',\n",

       " b'with the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up , loading their guns , kissing each other and uttering what sounds like \" rock and roll ! \" \\n ( actually , it\\'s \" lock and load \" ) , you can\\'t help thinking tarantino . \\nand of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery , the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie & clyde to natural born killers . \\nbut if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction , exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run , normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon . \\n \" inspired by true events \" -- we\\'ve heard that one before , and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated . . . \\nor so strangely poignant . \\nfor this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality , who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged . \\nbeginning with their final arrest , the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris ( luke perry ) , a policeman , and pam ( ashley judd ) , a factory worker . \\nthey fall in love and marry , but pam\\'s increasingly erratic behaviour ( going on spending sprees , slashing herself with a knife after an argument ) begin to trouble the solid and stable chris . \\nwhen chris gets sacked , they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up . \\nthen , chris begins to rob banks . . . \\nluke perry accomplishes the not-inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer . \\nmoustached , with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation , he is perfectly cast as the long-suffering husband . \\n ( it\\'s another of john mcnaughton\\'s coups of casting-against-type , after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory ) . \\nbut it is the character of pam who commands centrestage , and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness , making pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating person . \\nif the performance falls short of greatness , however , it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema , whether it\\'s in betty blue , tom & viv or georgia . \\nas in those movies , there\\'s the danger that the performance seems mannered , a collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece . \\njudd doesn\\'t entirely avoid this pitfall , but pam\\'s \\'craziness\\' is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more \\'normal\\' chris . \\nwhen pam reacts to her father-in-law\\'s death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones , chris\\' face is the picture of pained restraint . \\nof course , it\\'s the question of what is \\'normal\\' that is asked in normal life . \\nmcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity . \\nit is the rational chris that loves guns ( \" shooting is about precision , control \" ) and the \\'crazy\\' pam that loves astronomy and yearns for a dog ( who is then called chaos -- \" chaos and you and me . . . \\nwe\\'re a real family \" , she notes wryly ) . \\nit is chris\\' methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a successful bank robber ( his well-planned disguise as a bearded , roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness ) . \\nin the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery , a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out in the background : \" buy-more \" -- the perfectly respectable consumption-crazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases , and both of them into desperate situations . \\nit\\'s not a perfect film . \\nsome of the dialogue is a touch too banal ( perhaps intentionally ? ) . \\nthe use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pam\\'s crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film . \\nindeed , as in mcnaughton\\'s seminal film henry : portrait of a serial killer , it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism , the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre , that gives this determinedly unflashy , moving film its great strengths . \\nmcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet , coolly \\'realistic\\' method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer . \\nthe suburbs , with their miles of white-fenced houses and identikit malls , take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness . \\nin its very different way , this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malick\\'s badlands . \\nwhile pam shares the yearnings of malick\\'s heroes to escape from ordinary life , chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a \\'normal life\\' - their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies . \\nbut these are dreams defined by , constrained by , and even doomed by , the limitations of the \\'normal\\' , conventional world . \\npam\\'s final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs , where wild bushes grow -- symbolically the frontier , the outer limits of her society , but also quite literally the end of the road , where there is nowhere left to go but to the final tragic denouement . \\nthe flying inkpot\\'s rating system : * wait for the video . \\n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \\n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \\n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \\n * * * * * perfection . \\nsee it twice . \\n',\n",

       " b'even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor , his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality . \\nlike everyone else , dreyfuss has bills to pay , so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies . \\nconsequently , while his career highlights include jaws , close encounters of the third kind , stakeout , and tin men , his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador , let it ride , and now krippendorf\\'s tribe . \\nlet me start out by saying that krippendorf\\'s tribe is occasionally funny ( although never riotously so ) , but that\\'s about its only asset . \\nthe best word to describe this film is \" asinine . \" \\nthe target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes , which are aimed at someone going through puberty . \\nkrippendorf\\'s tribe tries to be a zany , off-the-wall comedy , but the film makers have forgotten three important rules . \\nthe first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist . \\nthe second is that viewers should be able to identify with , or at least care about , a character or two . \\nfinally , and most importantly , more than 5% of the jokes have to work . \\nonce upon a time , james krippendorf ( dreyfuss ) was a respected professor of anthropology at little bounderby college . \\nhe and his wife obtained a grant to seek out a \" lost tribe \" somewhere in the wilds of new guinea , a goal which they never accomplished . \\nshortly after their return from the failed trip , krippendorf\\'s wife died and he was left with the herculean task of raising three children -- shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) , and edmund ( carl michael linder ) -- on his own . \\nnow , over a year later , the college wants to see the results of the money they gave krippendorf ( which he has spent not on research , but on things for his family ) , so they send a new member of their faculty , professor veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , to inform him that he has been scheduled to give a lecture on his findings . \\nwhen he arrives at the college for the momentous event , rather than telling the truth and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds , he fabricates a tale about a mythical lost tribe , the \" shelmikedmu \" . \\nto provide video footage , he films his children dressed in native garb . \\nsoon , much to krippendorf\\'s surprise , the shelmikedmu are a national phenomenon . \\nbut one disaffected professor ( lily tomlin ) is determined to prove that the tribe is a fraud . \\nthe only way krippendorf\\'s tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters ( not to mention the viewers ) are dumber than dirt . \\nunfortunately , it\\'s impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this . \\ndirector todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a device to implement various dubious gags . \\nmeanwhile , attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture ( i . e . , how easily the public can be fooled into jumping on the bandwagon of the latest trend ) come across as feeble and derivative . \\nthe acting in underwhelming . \\ndreyfuss has definitely not given his \" all \" to the role of james krippendorf . \\nalongside him , jenna elfman , the spunky co-star of tv\\'s dharma and greg , radiates perkiness and little else . \\nthis quality , while fine for a 22-minute television program , quickly becomes irritating in the arena of a feature-length movie . \\nno one in the supporting cast -- lily tomlin , david ogden stiers , natasha lyonne ( woody allen\\'s daughter in everyone says i love you ) -- excels . \\ni know that a movie\\'s in trouble when it\\'s half the length of titanic , but seems much longer . \\nmost of what comes on screen is generic sit-com level material -- the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set . \\nif there\\'s any upside , it\\'s that i don\\'t see much box-office support developing for this lame , ill-marketed miscue . \\nkrippendorf\\'s tribe will quickly become extinct . \\n',\n",

       " b\"tim robbins and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy . \\nrobbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex with his boss . \\nhe goes into depression , and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual 'ghetto' side of every american city . \\nthere , lawernce attempts to steal his car , but to no avail , and is dragged along with robbin's on a trip to arizona . \\nthere , they hold up a store , are mistaken for two other robbers ( just like in my cousin vinny ) and are chased by the police , and the other robbers . \\nof course , there's gags along the way , usually from lawernce . \\nalthough the film is midly funny , and quite watchable , there's something so horribly familiar about it all . \\nthis film should really be called beverly hills midnight run there's lawernce with his wisecracking and heavy profanity , just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop , and pratically the same idea as midnight run . \\nit's full of all the road movie cliches , and even has a 'comedy' car chase , which just seemed so eighties . \\neven the credit sequence seemed to be out of a steve martin , or chevy chase , eighties comedy . \\nthere also isn't much chemistry between robbins and lawernce . \\nin planes , trains and automobiles , there was real chemistry between steve martin and john candy . \\nin nothing to lose , there is hardly chemistry at all . \\ntowards the end the chemistry seems to work , but for the bulk of the film , there is hardly any , \\nthe director directs the film in a workman like fashion , but gets the jokes across . \\nand although there is no chemistry between the two leads , they give good performances on their own . \\nlawerence gives a good eddie murphy performance , and robbin's is alright aswell . \\nhowever , robbin's performance is nowhere near as good as the characters he played in jacob's ladder , and the player . \\nin fact , if you want to see robbin's do comedy much better than in nothing to lose , i suggest you rent out the hudsucker proxy , where he is much funnier . \\nnothing to lose does have some funny moments in it , however . \\nthe humour isn't particulary sophisticated , but if you enojyed dumb & dumber , you might enjoy this . \\nthe characters in arizona are funny , and there's also a good scene where robbin's asks a shopkeeper which 'threatening approach' was better , lawerences ( which consisted of lawerence threatening to shoot the shopkeeper's ass , and swearing a lot ) , or himselfs , ( which was speaking in a deep , scary voice ) but the gags are predictable , the lack of chemistry infurating , and the ending too far-fetched and 'perfect' \\nnothing to lose then , is robbin's first 'bad' movie ( and hopefully his last ) , and suggests that odereick should twice before making another film . \\nhe nearly ruined carrey's career with ace ventura : when nature calls , let's hope he hasn't ruined robbin's ( or even lawerence's ) with nothing to lose . \\n\",\n",

       " b'before even seeing a single frame of the film , it would be easy to snicker at deep impact , in which a comet on a collision course with earth threatens the existence of all life on the planet . \\nit is the latest entry in this decade\\'s dubious revival of the \\'70s disaster film , and the first of two \" the sky is falling \" flicks to hit screens this year ( the other being this coming july\\'s armageddon , in which a meteor is the threat ) . \\nits tagline , \" oceans rise . \\ncities fall . \\nhope survives \" is not as cornball as that of the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight ( \" they came in alone . . . the only way out . . . \\nis together \" ) , but it\\'s every bit as treacly . \\nthe opening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at . \\nthe cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions , such as the usual opening \" roll call , \" in which all the major characters and their personal problems are introduced . \\nthe most prominent of the \" personal \" stories is that of ambitious tv news reporter jenny lerner ( tea leoni ) , who is distraught that her father ( maximilian schell ) left her mother ( vanessa redgrave ) for a younger woman ( rya kihlstedt ) . \\nwhat is just as snicker-worthy is how this co-venture between paramount and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another high-profile corporate collaboration , microsoft and nbc\\'s cable news network msnbc , which employs jenny , who is the film\\'s ostensible main character . \\nin the vision of america presented here , msnbc is the television news source of choice in every home , when in reality it only reaches a fraction of the country . \\nthe initial signs point toward something along the lines of a volcano or dante\\'s peak , but there\\'s one thing about deep impact i underestimated : the skills of director mimi leder . \\nshe won an emmy for her helming work on nbc\\'s smash er , which is essentially a weekly disaster movie , each episode featuring a new set of guest stars with their own personal and medical crises . \\nthe challenge presented by this format to the director is twofold : ( 1 ) to make the audience care for these guest characters , regardless of how briefly seen or thinly written they are , and ( 2 ) powerfully tug at the emotions without being heavy-handed or overly melodramatic . \\nhaving passed the \" er challenge \" in numerous episodes and showed a flair for creating suspense in the peacemaker , leder could not be a better fit to bring michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin\\'s rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen . \\nas the countdown to impact progresses , the ominous feeling of doom is palpable , leading the final act to take on a surprisingly convincing and affecting emotional dimension . \\nthere\\'s nothing here that will profoundly move anyone , but the fact that anything manages to touch the heart is high achievement in a genre generally more concerned with effects . \\nsituations that initially feel contrived , such as jenny\\'s familial crisis and the teenage romance between sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) and comet discoverer leo biederman ( elijah wood ) , achieve some poignance ; and even the more vaguely drawn characters , including u . s . president tom beck ( morgan freeman ) , astronaut spurgeon \" fish \" tanner ( robert duvall ) , and his rather faceless crew ( ron eldard , jon favreau , mary mccormack , blair underwood , and alexander baluyev ) aboard the comet-bombing spacecraft messiah , have their share of touching moments . \\nthe latter fact owes a debt to the actors , who all do a solid job and are well-cast , with the possible exception of leoni ; she delivers a decent performance , but her trademark unconventional speech rhythms and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as a star news broadcaster . \\nalthough its catastrophic theme and impressive special effects work ( the giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular ) place deep impact in the same category as the likes of twister , it is the first of the \\'90s disaster films to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions that ring true--a film that makes a genuine impact , even if it isn\\'t as deep as hoped . \\n',\n",

\\ni know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre , but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror . \\ncome on , the guy looks like the gorton\\'s fisherman , and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate . \\nthough his lightning-lit appearances ellicited much-needed laughter in the theater , his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film , and that\\'s * really * saying something . \\nso , all that\\'s left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy . \\nboth prance about in tightfitting , revealing outfits or in various states of undress , yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene . \\nhewitt , however , does do a post-shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite . \\n . \\n . titillating . \\nthis scene alone made this one-star turkey earn two stars under my rating system . \\notherwise , hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves . \\nearly in the film , for instance , brandy wins the trip to the bahamas . \\nshe and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever . \\ni needed extra-strength tylenol after that part . \\noh , and the film\\'s conclusion , talk about repetitive ! \\npeople who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still know\\'s ending at least 5 minutes before it happens . \\nboring ! \\ni saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater . \\nadmission is only one dollar on wednesdays , and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them . \\nit\\'s usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience , who don\\'t seem to mind participating in a mass \" mystery science theater 3000 \" -type viewing . \\ni still know what you did last summer , however , produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience , underscoring how bad it * really * is . \\nif it weren\\'t for the main actresses\\' revealing wardrobes , i\\'d have had a very , very hard time sitting through this lame sequel . \\ni can\\'t imagine trying to watch it on video ( horror films seem 10 times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation ) and wouldn\\'t recommend it to people , unless they\\'re horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy . \\ni read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works . \\nwhat a depressing thought . \\nhewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act . \\nrated r , this film contains lots of violence , several gory scenes , and a couple nubile , horny teenagers--though the sex act itself is always thwarted . \\ni\\'d say this is unsuitable for kids , but teens wouldn\\'t have a problem sitting through it , especially since they obviously compose the film\\'s target audience . \\n',\n",

\\nthey require someone experienced with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid . \\n ( in one unintentionally ( ? ) \\nhilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep-core driller they built based on his own blueprints ; it is poorly constructed-harry criticizes almost every aspect of it . \\nwe trust nasa to build space shuttles that can land on twirling asteroids ? ) \\nharry assembles the obligatory \" ragtag \" bunch of \" cowboys \" , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck ) . \\nonce they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes . \\nwhether or not they save the day , i will not reveal . \\nnor will you care . \\ni will say this : you know you\\'re in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope . \\nwillis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck . \\ntheir big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the material . \\nsteve buscemi\\'s character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic . \\n \" rockhound \" , as he\\'s called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film . \\nso why did they bring him up there to begin with ? \\nrather , why write him into the film ? -give \\nhis almost-witty one-liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig . \\ni\\'m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue . \\nliv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father\\'s band\\'s ( \" aerosmith \" ) songs grace the soundtrack . \\ndirector michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on-screen . \\n ( the middle hour is a non-sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate\\'s brain . ) \\nwhenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out \" we lost ( insert dead person\\'s last name here ) ! \" \\ni must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one , and close-ups of the corpses\\' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood . \\narmageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla . \\nit looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework . \\nit has a vivid soundmix . \\nbut at almost two-and-a-half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story . \\nthe love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic-fever . \\nbollocks ! \\nthe lovers in the film are miles apart throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler . \\nremember a little film called jaws ? \\nin this film , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark . \\nthey didn\\'t much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another . \\none of jaws\\' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories . \\nthis is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we\\'ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end . \\nnot once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-i\\'d be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before \" action \" was called . \\na male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don\\'t bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery . \\nto this , i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even : this team couldn\\'t build a birdhouse . \\nand if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-i\\'ve never been a prouder wimp my whole life . \\n',\n",
       " b'i am a steven seagal fan . \\ni only say this now because \" mufti splenetik \" isn\\'t my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things . \\nany proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on . \\nseagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue , heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones ( which we\\'ll always hear when seagal does his limb-twisting thing ) , rarely a female co-lead in sight ( unless it\\'s a real-life model-wife who hasn\\'t worked since weird science ) and , usually the worst possible titles you can imagine . \\nnot to mention very straightforward plots , generally all-round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather-face himself in that same black outfit he\\'s been in since nico doing his \" my hands are sharp , nimble knives \" thing , seagal the stoic , sir petrified ponytail , duke of dull . \\nin the glimmer man , seagal breaks out of this formula : he gets a * sidekick * , attempts to banter , and puts on a new vest . \\nhe\\'s also put on quite a lot of weight . \\nsmall potatoes , you may say , a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to , but damnit , if it ain\\'t broke , why fix it ? \\n ( more on this disappointed person\\'s dashed expectations later ) . \\nas jack cole , seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past . \\nwhile he and his partner ( played by keenen ivory wayans ) are investigating a series of ritual killings , cole himself becomes a suspect , especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole . \\nit turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin ( you just can\\'t trust these homicide detectives ) , someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them , and hence , well , you know , that \" glimmer man \" thing . \\nan increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger , more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman ( bob gunton ) , cole\\'s former cia boss ( brian cox ) and deals involving chemical weapons . \\nthe glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff , drawing ( as with his other films ) elements from the hotter films of the year ( eg , se7en ) . \\nit\\'s the other changes that disappoint . \\nfor example , although there\\'s a fair amount of violence in this movie , there\\'s also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans , probably the best known of the wayans tribe ( how many are there , exactly ? ) from television\\'s \" in living colour . \" \\nwayans plays whiney straightman to seagal\\'s bead-adorned and brocade-draped cole , keeping up his \" are you crazy \" part of the dialogue with wasted zest . \\nas campbell , wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner\\'s eccentric habits , but the chemistry between the two is minimal , and seagal\\'s wooden comebacks make for painful watching . \\na cook in under seige 2 , seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble . \\nhe chants , refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies . \\nagain , a benign ( if trite ) plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual . \\nheck , he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film . \\nis that a lot to ask of the seague ? \\ntoo much . \\nseagal\\'s best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies : to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages , and to do it silently , and alone . \\nnot for seagal , the snappy one-liners of arnold and stallone , nor the attempts to show that he can act , much less think . \\nno kindergarten cop , no oscar , just simple , unadulterated deathblows . \\nthat\\'s really how it must have started : like-minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing , knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else . \\nwe trusted him . \\nwe got to know him . \\nnow , betrayal . \\ni don\\'t know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he\\'s going to try to be funny again . \\ni\\'ll try , but it won\\'t be easy . \\nif you haven\\'t watched the glimmer man yet , you might want to wait for the video to come out . \\nit\\'s easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences . \\nafter all , if we can\\'t depend on our fantasies , what can we depend on ? \\nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \\n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \\n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \\n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \\n * * * * * perfection . \\nsee it twice . \\nmufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan . \\neverybody makes mistakes once in awhile . \\n',\n",
       " b'the truman show ( paramount pictures ) running time : 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait , jim carrey\\'s dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen . \\nin case you\\'ve been asleep for the last few months , the plot centres on truman burbank ( carrey ) who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven . \\nhis life seems so perfect , however , because it\\'s controlled by christoff ( harris ) creator of the truman show , the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of . \\nthat\\'s right , burbank\\'s life is being broadcast live to the american public , and seahaven and all it\\'s inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage . \\nthe film takes the jerry springer format one step too far . . . \\nwith an idea so different , it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator . \\nluckily , the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages , yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie . \\ntalking of carrey , he\\'s perfect in this movie , enjoying the best role in his career . \\nhis character is a re-inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask ( 1994 ) and is completely suited to carrey\\'s persona . \\nhe occasionally falls into ace ventura mode , shrieking and being silly , but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey . \\nhe\\'s not completely dramatic like the film promises , however . \\ned harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff , the megalomaniac creator of the show . \\nquiet and well spoken , he burns an image into the viewer . \\nunfortunately , he\\'s barely in the film , and for the first hour dosen\\'t appear at all ! \\nalso disappointing is natascha mcelhone\\'s character sylvia . \\nshe plays the role well , but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her . \\nthe supporting cast is excellent , and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect , so perfect it\\'s creepy . \\nthe philip glass soundtrack is also superb , and is used to great effect during the film . \\npeter weir keeps the film going , clearly having fun . \\nthe film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card . \\nalthough it is slightly slow to begin with , about half an hour into film the pace really picks up , and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll . \\nsadly , though , the film is practically over when the film is in full steam . \\nalso , concerning the ending , it is slightly too ambiguous , which was disappointing . \\nthe screenwriter , andrew niccol , who bought us gattaca ( 1997 ) delivers an entertaining script , and manages to keep the plot in trim . \\nwhile christoff\\'s plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly , they never go over the line , which would have been easy for niccol to do . \\nalso , there\\'s some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show . \\noverall , the truman show is excellent entertainment . \\ncertainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces , it should be viewed by everyone . \\nit offers something to every member of the audience , and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed . \\noverall rating= \\nreview by david wilcock ? 1998 \\n \" you know , for kids \" - norville barnes \\n',\n",
       " b'the first species was a moderately-successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects , a few well- paced action sequences , and frequent views of model-turned-actress natasha henstridge sans clothing . \\nhowever , it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel . \\nand , considering the quality of species 2 , it\\'s obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead . \\nthe only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is . \\nif you throw away the plot , which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence , logic , coherence , and consistency , species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience . \\nof course , that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys ( who , at least in theory , shouldn\\'t be able to get into an \" r \" -rated film ) and connoisseurs of bad movies . \\nthere\\'s enough blood , gore , simulated sex , and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring . \\nthis is a grade z exploitation flick that\\'s ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment . \\nsomewhere , someplace , i recall hearing species 2 described as \" erotic . \" \\ni would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie , because he ( or she ) has a peculiar notion of eroticism . \\nsure , there\\'s a lot of sex and nudity , but it\\'s almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a woman\\'s abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free , splattering blood and gore in all directions . \\nanyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater . \\ni suppose the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge ( and , to get the obvious question out of the way -- yes , she does remove her top , but only once , and only briefly ) . \\nalthough the character she played in the original species is dead , government scientists still have the dna , and , out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse , they decide to create another clone . \\nthis creature , dubbed \" eve \" by its creator , dr . laura baker ( played by marg helgenberger , reprising her role ) , is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile . \\nmeanwhile , man has finally set foot on mars . \\na team of three , led by patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , has traveled to the red planet , but when they return to earth , they bring something with them . \\nross has become a half-human/half-alien hybrid , and he\\'s soon mating like crazy , collecting the blood-soaked children that are the result of each sex session . \\nhis intention is obviously world domination . \\nstanding in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film , preston lennox ( michael madsen ) , and one of patrick\\'s fellow astronauts , dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) . \\nbut when patrick learns about eve , a female of his kind , there\\'s no damping his ardor . \\ni\\'m not sure what the budget for species 2 was , but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors ( as opposed to being diverted into the special effects ) . \\nmichael madsen and marg helgenberger , both back for a second round , are clearly on hand to do as little as they can , grab the money , and run . \\nditto for james cromwell , who plays patrick\\'s father -- \" underused \" is too kind a word to describe his involvement ( \" invisible \" would be more like it ) . \\ngeorge dzundza gets to do a little scenery- chewing as an angry-but-inept general . \\nmeanwhile , justin lazard\\'s performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridge\\'s limited abilities look good by comparison . \\nthe only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson , who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick . \\ncomplete with cheesy special effects , bare breasts around every narrative corner , and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter , species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics . \\ndirector peter medak , a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume , has added another forgettable title , but at least he appears to have had fun doing it , which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness . \\ndo i recommend the movie ? \\nabsolutely not , but i will admit that species 2 is dopey enough that it didn\\'t try my patience to the degree that some pseudo-intellectual bad movies do . \\nhere\\'s hoping there\\'s no species 3 . \\n',\n",

\\nnot surprisingly , the most energetic performance is given by samuel l . jackson , but his harry isn\\'t a person ; he\\'s a walking plot device spouting occasionally-witty dialogue . \\ndustin hoffman isn\\'t lively or particularly good -- it\\'s ironic that this , which may be his worst work in a decade , has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination ( for wag the dog ) . \\nsharon stone and peter coyote are both flat . \\ntheir characters exhibit little evidence of emotion ; automatons would have been as effective . \\nthen there\\'s queen latifa , who , despite getting fifth billing in the credits ( ahead of liev schreiber , who boasts at least quadruple her screen time ) , has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count . \\ni like to think that levinson and hoffman , recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be , chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance ( the low-budget picture was filmed during sphere\\'s lengthy pre-production phase ) . \\nif that\\'s the case , forgiveness is granted . \\ni\\'m less inclined to look favorably upon crichton , although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume ( jurassic park and the levinson-directed disclosure come to mind ) . \\neven if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process , crichton\\'s credit as a producer disallows him absolution . \\nhe was a willing participant in a creative travesty . \\nno wonder sphere is being released in february , in the midst of the early year\\'s cinematic wasteland . \\nit deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic , which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninth-consecutive weekend atop the box office heap . \\n',\n",

       " b'some movies ask you to leave your brain at the door , some movies ask you to believe in the impossible to really have a good time . \\nplaying god asks just one simple , eensy , teensy thing so it can fully entertain you , it\\'s accomplished in just four easy to follow steps : crack open your skull , scoop out your brain , squish it under your foot several times and reverse steps two and one . \\ncongratulations , you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy a whole lot of nothing . \\nsome movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been a good movie , others are simply good ideas that are badly executed . \\nthen there\\'s playing god , which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the union of a drunk director , actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and a bunch of rip-offs ( or homages as they like to call it ) from other , better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet . \\nharsh ? maybe . \\njustified ? \\nhell yes ! \\nthis is a movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes . \\nfor example , a gunman bursts into a garden with the two guns in his hands firing away . \\nthis does look moderately kool , but the camera lingers on the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling : \" oooh , look look ! \\njohn woo ! \\ntwo guns blazing ! \\nslooooow motion ! \" \\nand if that wasn\\'t enough , you can also hear the script grunting under the effort it must take to try and make every single line of dialogue sound like something deep and meaningful like in a tarantino movie . \\npoor timothy hutton gets to deliver most of the corny lines , you have to admire the effort he puts into it , this guy deserves better . \\nunlike most movies this one does not suffer from \" stupid bad guy \" syndrome , just to make things a little different this time we get stupid heroes . \\nexample : duchovny manages to distract a bad guy by making him go into the bathroom to get some bandages . \\nnow the bad guy is , like , stoned , man , so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero . \\n ( term used as loosely as possible ) \\nsurvival instincts and a good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun , which our hero does , but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds . \\neven when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it , going so far as to actually wonder if he should place a finger near the trigger . \\nmind you , i\\'ve never fired a shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs , be he stoned or not . \\nsome will argue that our hero does not have a killer instinct , the hell with that ! \\ntwo fbi guys have just been shot in front me , along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second . \\nsolution ? \\nboom ! \\ni\\'ll take the time to feel sorry about it later thank you very much . \\nanother prime example of the idiot hero syndrome : \\nour boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her . \\nhe knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of a building and that he might be running into a room full of people with itchy trigger fingers . \\nhe still has his shotgun , bring it along you say ? \\nno thanks , i\\'ll just ditch it in the back of my car . \\nand the real kicker is this : when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised ! \\nwhile we are on the subject of getting shot , why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door ? \\ni\\'ve got no formal training but even i know you never sit with your back to the door . \\nask mr . wild bill , the first and only time he did not sit with his back to a wall cost him his life . \\nthis is the major problem with this movie , any mook could have thought of a hundred ways to make it better . \\nis it so much to ask that hollywood actually put a little common sense into their characters ? \\nfor instance : \\nour heroes hide at duchovny\\'s summer home , now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment . \\nok , this time our hero does get himself a gun and has it at his side most of the time . \\nbut see , our hero is a drug addict and guess what ? \\nhe chooses now to go clean and suffer through dt . \\noh sure , he\\'ll be really impressive when the bad guys come calling . \\ngoing clean is really honorable of him , but i would have waited until i did not need to be conscious or being able to fire a gun . \\nfor an enjoyable performance by timothy hutton , plot holes the size of godzilla , getting our intelligence insulted and several \" oh come on ! \" \\nmoments . \\n',\n",

       " b'every once in a while you see a film that is so effective in delivering the goods that it is easy to forget , and forgive , its glaring imperfections . \\nsuch is the case with ? good will hunting ? , a subtle character study about a socially inept mathematics genius who struggles to find his path in life . \\ndespite some serious character problems , this is still a very good film . \\nyou probably know about the plot so i ? ll make it quick . \\nwill hunting ( damon ) is a janitor at m . i . t . , he ? s really smarter than einstein but nobody knows it . \\nhe likes to go out with his friend chuckie ( affleck ) and their other working-class buddies and drink beer . \\nhe ? s good-looking , charismatic , and witty but has a terrible time with authority and stiff college folk . \\nafter getting into a tiff with the law , a distinguished professor ( skarsg ? rd ) discovers will ? s genius and offers him a chance to clean up his record and avoid jail time , at a price : he must attend weekly sessions with a therapist and work on various mathematical problems ( that have stumped the academic elite ) with the professor . \\nafter outsmarting and scaring the hell out of a couple of different psychologists he meets his match when hooked up with a once-promising therapist named sean maguire ( williams ) who has his own problems . \\nin the meantime will meets a british medical school student ( driver ) and they begin to fall in love . \\nthe story starts out well enough and is a pretty original basis for a film . \\neven though we ? ve seen movies about misunderstood , erratic prodigies before ( ? shine ? ring a bell ? ) , the script here creates a complex narrative that doesn ? t just focus solely on one character . \\nalas though , this is not a perfect film , as much as you feel like it could ? ve been while watching it . \\nthe one real problem i had with it is the unrealistic nature of the main character . \\nis it possible for a lowly janitor to be this intelligent ? \\nof course . \\nis it possible for him to be estranged from any deep , human relationships ? \\nusually , yes . \\nbut , is it possible for him to also be so handsome , funny , quick with the tongue , and city-street tough ? \\nnot very likely . \\ncome on , usually these guys are total nerds who can ? t even buy their own shirts , much less talk down a harvard student in a hip pub while picking up phone numbers from pretty med . -school \\ngirls . \\nwill is just a little too perfect , and in order to accept the character your disbelief suspension needs to be in excellent working condition . \\nthe heavy-handed , anti-war statement made by will at a government job interview late in the film is also boorish , overlong , pompous , and completely unnecessary . \\nall this sounds pretty bad , but the film somehow makes up for it in other ways . \\ndamon ? s acting overshadows the fact that the character is slightly unbelievable , his performance is truly extraordinary . \\nwhich leads me to the really good part of the review . \\nthe strength of this movie can be summed up in one single word : acting . \\ni can ? t recall seeing a film recently that was so well-acted from top to bottom . \\nfrom minnie driver ? s frustrated lover to ben affleck ? s laid-back best friend , and all the small roles in between , the performances are magnificent . \\nrobin williams ? skill is a given as a bereaved psychologist who could ? ve had a legendary career but was knocked off the path somewhere down the line . \\nthe real gem though is stellan skarsg ? rd ? s turn as professor lambeau , an award-winning mathematician who feels reduced in comparison to a younger , smarter will hunting . \\nthe scenes between williams and skarsg ? rd , as two old college pals who ? ve been brought back together by this enigmatic kid , display some of the best acting i ? ve ever seen . \\nwhen i say delivering the goods , this is what i ? m talking about . \\nwatching these two work is what going to see movies is all about . \\ngus van sant ? s ( to die for , drugstore cowboy ) cold , urban direction is right on , as well as danny elfman ? s sauntering musical score . \\ni highly recommend ? good will hunting ? . \\ndespite its faults , it is still an intriguing and fascinating film and you are not likely to see a better acted one this year . \\n',\n",
       " b\"-- comedy , rated pg , runs about 1 : 40 -- starring : john goodman , kathy moriarty , and a bunch of teenagers -- directed by joe dante and written by charles hass -- \\nsummary : lawrence woolsley ( john goodman ) brings his new horror film mant ! \\nto premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis . \\nhe hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town . \\nwe see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them . \\nquick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee . \\nthe mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely . \\nunlike many comedies this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh . \\nthe makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story . \\nthe performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master . \\nso i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours . \\nlonger , more detailed review : [beware of spoilers] \\nthe primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell . \\ntoo many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh . \\nyou watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you . \\nmatinee is not like that . \\ni left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis . \\ni found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film . \\nbut most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters . \\nthe comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film he brings to key west . \\ni believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today . \\nhe is highly expressive both physically and vocally . \\ni felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink . \\nthe other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature , however , while the star , goodman is actually not at the center of the film . \\nthe movie is really the story of the four teenagers , discovering who they are and what they want , against a background where at any minute it could all end . \\ni thought the kids reaction were highly realistic . \\nthey tried to block it out , they tried to escape from the concerns of their world . \\nunfortunately it kept creeping back in , particularly with the fear , and the chaos of the time . \\nwhile the comedy centered on goodman , and the drama on the teens , there was a great deal of overlap . \\nseveral aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light . \\none example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store . \\nif you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy , but it works here . \\nanother reason i like this film is that i like b- science fiction movies . \\none of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space . \\n ( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies , but one of my favorite to see . ) \\nwhile mant ! \\nnever got made , many films like it were , and mant ! \\nserves mostly as dante's homage to the b-films he loves . \\nso again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good , humorous story . \\nthis isn't a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent , well-thought out , film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way . \\nenjoy ! \\n\",\n",
       " b\"i remember making a pact , right after `patch adams' , to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality . \\nbut darn it , `music of the heart' is just layered with feel-good material and bright characterizations . \\nit's hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it's manipulation . \\nin addition , it's also a terrific family film . \\nthis is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari , who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools . \\nit could also be described as `mrs . \\nstreep's opus' . \\nyes , meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari , and that brings both good news and bad . \\nout of the gate , possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing , it is relatively difficult to identify with roberta's character and grasp her academic point-of-view . \\nshe is very strict with her students , but what insight does that create into the story ? \\nslowly but surely , we begin to recognize the intentions of the character , and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied . \\none thoroughly interesting fact about `music of the heart' lies with the unlikely presence in the director's chair : horror veteran wes craven . \\nafter leaving an impression with the `scream' films and the original `nightmare on elm street' , craven has attempted a precarious cross-over to drama . \\nat first , his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious , but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material . \\nit doesn't carry the heart-warming courage of `mr . \\nholland's opus' , but `music of the heart' is casually assured and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth . \\nthe tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate . \\nyes , oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep , but it's the solid ensemble cast that makes `music of the heart' work . \\nangela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams , the principal at an inner city school who initially doesn't hire roberta because of her lack of experience . \\nblue-eyed adian quinn is endearing , as always , playing a new love interest . \\ngloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of a supportive second-grade teacher , and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force . \\nit's like a schoolteacher's version of `thelma and louise' , in a restrained but effective manner . \\nthe movie tackles more issues than just guaspari's teaching of violin . \\nthere's some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons , who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman . \\nin it's dramatic build-up , the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling and warmth . \\nit's a good movie for anyone to see , although missing out on the experience would not be a life-altering decision . \\nit's commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult cross-over , and also for achieving his intricate goal . \\nwatching this heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments , who may ask yourself : this is the guy who directed `scream' ? \\nof course , when the third installment of that series comes around in february 2000 ( with craven directing ) , you may find yourself wondering : this is the guy who directed `music of the heart' ? \\nmission accomplished , wes . \\nthankfully , there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film . \\nin it's entirety , it's a wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole family , despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile . \\nthe child actors are cute and perform up to par , even if some of their problems are clich ? d and predictable in the extreme . \\nthe mother who doesn't want her son to be learning `white man's music' , the unexpected casuality . . . \\nbasically everything is there . \\nit doesn't strike the perfect chord , but `music of the heart' is highly convincing . \\nthe uplifting true story of roberta guaspari could have been told better , but `music of the heart' is still edifying enough to properly divulge her morals . \\n\",\n",

       " b'only a year after the initial release of \" scream , \" the horror send-up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre , the inevitable sequel \" scream 2 \" has arrived in our theaters . \\nwhile the tongue-in-cheek , parodic element is still noticeable in this film , it\\'s really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story . \\nthe first film , while often violent and gruesome , was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant . \\nthe premise of \" scream 2 \" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called \" stab , \" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers ( courtney cox ) about the events in \" scream , \" is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening . \\ni had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy . \\nits conclusion , in which a bleeding , wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it\\'s a publicity stunt , is more surreal and disturbing than anything else . \\nthe satire in \" scream 2 \" thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general . \\nalthough resident horror film geek randy ( jamie kennedy ) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels ( and , interestingly enough , how they are usually inferior to their predecessors ) , the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well . \\neverything from \" friends \" and \" saved by the bell \" to \" showgirls \" and \" terminator 2 \" is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning , and there aren\\'t any \" wes carpenter \" jokes this time . \\nmore importantly , this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film . \\nthe killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from \" scream \" ( in fact , the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense ) , weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety , and one man seems willing to save the heroine\\'s life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show . \\nunderstandably , \" scream 2 \" does not go so far as to actually blame the movies , but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted . \\ncouple that with the fact that several of the characters , most notably the lead character sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , are fairly well-developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine-chilling suspense , and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right . \\nwe don\\'t just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore - we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered ( and , in one case , a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust ) and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner . \\nwhile i have not seen any of his other work , it\\'s easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated \" slasher film \" director , as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing . \\nunfortunately , \" scream 2 \" occasionally reverts to the time-honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window . \\nfor example , several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later - there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick , but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion . \\nthere are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that ( s ) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction . \\nas for the question of whether or not \" scream 2 \" is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor . \\n . \\n . \\nwell , it\\'s hard to say . \\ni gave the first \" scream \" 3 1/2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light-hearted send-up . \\n \" scream 2 \" bounces all over the place stylistically , but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment . \\ni\\'m not sure which is the better movie , but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing : sequels , however much randy might argue , do not necessarily suck . \\n',\n",
       " b\"cinema has been around for about a hundred years now . ? \\nit's not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film , but i'd like to think that i'm beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time . \\nrecently , i've seen the films of hitchcock , capra , fellini , godard , kurosawa , chaplin , lang , and many others . \\n ? those men were talented artists , and their films reflect their genius . ? \\nthey are likely to be remembered for . \\n . \\n . \\nwell , quite a while . ? \\ni like this film , too . ? \\nyes , it's a disaster-slash-action movie . ? \\ntrue , its budget is a lot more money than i'll ever see in my lifetime . ? \\nand there's not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money . ? \\nin fact , i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film , had they thought it would've been more profitable . \\ni certainly don't care what their intentions were , because michael bay ( the rock ) is such a skilled director that i doubt he'd ever make a film that is difficult to sit through . \\nof course , skillful direction doesn't complete the package , but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together . \\nthe story is well-thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) , the acting is terrific , the script is sharp , and -- get this -- there are characters . \\nyes , you read that right . \\narmageddon actually has characters you can care about ! \\nif you don't like this film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this can be . \\nif you've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story . \\nit turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film . \\nso , it's up to the u . s . government to stop it . \\n ( why the u . s . is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated . ) \\ntheir plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within . \\nthe head driller is harry stamper ( bruce willis ) . \\nhis group of men is a colorful bunch , including a . j . \\n ( ben affleck ) , chick ( will patton ) , and rockhound ( steve buscemi ) . \\nthere's also an interesting triangle formed between a . j . , harry , and grace ( liv tyler ) , who is harry's daughter . \\na . j . \\nand grace are , of course , romantically intertwined , and dad isn't too happy with the situation . \\nit's absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you'd like to call armageddon . \\nit's not about story -- it's about viscera and action , and thrills-a-minute , and all that stuff . \\nit's incidental , really , that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable , because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds' thought to what actually happens . \\nbut bay is the one to congratulate in this case , for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better . \\ni think most of the budget went to cameras alone , because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles . \\ntake the spectacular opening scene , for instance , in which a meteor shower obliterates new york . \\na meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building , which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars . \\nthe action itself might take five seconds in real life , but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways . \\ni like his quick-edit style , because it's abrasive and exhausting to watch . \\nit's also very loud , and obnoxiously noisy at times . \\nbut it's fun to be obnoxious sometimes . \\nthe special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame . \\ndeep impact , visually , has absolutely nothing on armageddon , and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable . \\nspecial effects are very important in a film like this : if they're not good , then the image is not convincing , and the film doesn't work . \\neverything here looks bright and explosive -- from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers , all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid . \\nthe effects that don't look totally real are still a pleasure to behold , and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice-looking that it actually qualifies as art . \\nof course , all of this would add up to little more than an above-average light show , if i didn't get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action . \\nthe film is two and a half hours long , and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action . \\nmuch of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters' subplots . \\ni won't suggest that these are complex characters , but their problems are real , and the emotions aren't put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way . \\nin fact , there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up , and that's a lot more than i can say about deep impact , which was banking on the feel-good parts of its story . \\nbruce willis is terrific , and i'm glad to see him bigger than life again ( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing ) . \\ntyler and affleck are great together , and make a convincing couple -- all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level . \\npatton , who is a magnificent actor , thankfully is not wasted here , and the minor subplot revolving around his ex-wife and son is very moving . \\nthe comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare ( who plays a crazy russian astronaut ) is nifty , and keeps the film lively and funny . \\ni wasn't challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon , and i don't mind too much . \\nbut the film doesn't insult my intelligence -- it's pitched perfectly to entertain , which is what all it really wants to do . \\nit's not mindless and escapist , but well-crafted cinema . \\nit might have been created for the wrong reasons , but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good , in spite of the producers and the budget . \\ni'm not saying that films like this are risky moves . \\nwhat i am saying is that armageddon is a big , loud , expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms . \\n\",\n",

       " b'a cinematic version of one of john irving\\'s novels is always cause for celebration even if , as in the case of \" simon birch , \" the treatment is merely \" suggested by , \" rather than strictly based on , the book . \\nsuggested means that irving , author of the acclaimed \" the world according to garp , \" sold the rights to his novel \" a prayer for owen meany \" to the disney machine for $1 million , but wouldn\\'t grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names . \\nthat\\'s an odd decision--irving claims it\\'s to protect both himself and the novel--but it\\'s one that doesn\\'t unduly harm the finished product . \\nirving\\'s books are rich and complex works , full of intriguing , colorful characters . \\n \" a prayer for owen meany \" is no exception ; it tells the story of an unusual boy--called simon birch in the film version--who is uncommonly small in stature and possesses a high-pitched falsetto voice , \" like strangled mice . \" \\nsimon believes himself to be \" god\\'s instrument , \" placed on this earth to somehow effect god\\'s plan . \\nsimon is played by ian michael smith , who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which , among other things , prevents bones , ligaments , and joints from developing normally . \\nsmith\\'s debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for \" simon birch \" ; however , the producers unwisely favored form over function--smith\\'s acting abilities are limited at best . \\nanother drawback is that in the book , simon\\'s condition is described the way irving describes any of his characters--in careful , loving detail . \\nwatching \" simon birch , \" however , creates a different feeling altogether ; the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character , surely something irving would not have intended . \\nsimon himself tends to be too cute and irritating , a combination of smith\\'s rookie status as an actor and the precocious one-liners he\\'s forced to deliver , courtesy mark steven johnson , the film\\'s director and screenwriter . \\nfortunately , simon birch isn\\'t the real star of the film that bears his name . \\nsimon is more of a catalyst , allowing his co-stars to shape the story , and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outstanding supporting performances , saving the film from an obsequious , manipulative destiny . \\nfirst and foremost is joseph mazzello ( \" jurassic park \" ) , who is nothing less than remarkable as simon\\'s best friend , joe . \\nmazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 year old , ripe with laughter , pain , and tears ; he is certainly an emerging talent . \\nashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca , joe\\'s single mother , and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend , ben . \\ndavid strathairn and jan hooks play the town\\'s reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others . \\nthere\\'s even a surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from . . . \\nwell , that would be telling . \\nperhaps \" suggested by \" the novel is the appropriate way to go after all , since \" simon birch \" only focuses on one chapter , one year , of simon\\'s extraordinary life . \\nthe film also changes the book\\'s ending to one that is more melodramatic , yet necessary given simon\\'s lot . \\nthe flavor of irving\\'s original novel remains , however--the passions , friendships , and insecurities that come with a change of seasons to the little community of gravestown , maine , and the engaging oddballs , both big and small , who reside there . \\n',\n",

\\nwhy did tim robbins\\' character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside ? \\nshouldn\\'t the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach ? \\nwhy are the characters such idiots ? \\nbecause the script makes little attempt to properly develop them . \\nall the \" conflict \" is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene ( which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot ) during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know : \" jim , it\\'s too bad you can\\'t go on this mission because you were determined \\'psychologically inadequate\\' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together \" -- does anyone really talk like this ? \\ncan\\'t we find out these things in a less grating matter , like maybe in a flashback ? \\nthe whole film is like that . \\nthe filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what\\'s going on ; they must * tell * us exactly what we\\'re looking at * every * time . \\nsample dialogue from the film : ( shot of mars ) astronaut a : \" look , there\\'s mars \" astronaut b : \" you sure that\\'s mars ? \" \\nastronaut a : \" yeah , that\\'s mars all right . \" \\nastronaut c : \" hey , are you guys looking at mars ? \" \\nthat exchange isn\\'t actually in \" mission to mars , \" but i wouldn\\'t be surprised if it were . \\nfor all their cribbing from kubrick , spielberg , james cameron , and even ron howard , the makers of this film haven\\'t learned to do something all those directors did very well : show and don\\'t tell . \\nde palma used to know how , but seems to have forgotten . \\nthis is mentally-challenged filmmaking ; they assume the audience won\\'t get what\\'s going on , so they explain everything five times over . \\nfourth-graders may appreciate this , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted . \\nthe principal actors sleepwalk their way through \" mission to mars , \" never managing to do away with an apparent \" i\\'m just here to get a paycheck \" attitude . \\ncheadle stumbles over his awkward lines . \\narmin mueller-stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo . \\nrobbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard \" decent guy \" performance . \\nand sinise hams it up with \" wistful \" facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by kim delaney , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy-handed monologue about the meaning of life ) , and especially during the stolen-from-no-less-than-three-movies ( a lollipop to whoever names them ) conclusion , which combines endless , obvious explanation and sub-par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then . \\nand of course , these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in \" 2001 \" who facilitated the evolution of life on earth ; those aliens were from an * unknown * world . \\nit could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy \" mission to mars , \" but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow-going . \\nleisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it , but all of the substance of \" mission to mars \" has been stolen from other films , and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters . \\nsupposedly we\\'re intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one ( totally different from the one-character-decides-not-to-return ending of \" armageddon \" ) , but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning . \\nme , i alternated between the two . \\nthere is only one good thing about the way \" mission to mars \" finally ends : the fact that the movie is over . \\n',\n",
       " b'based on the relatively unknown ( in comparison to spider-man ) marvel comic book , blade tells the story of half-vampire half-human ( played by wesley snipes ) who was born of a vampire\\'s latest meal . \\nnow swearing vengeance against all vampires , blade hunts them all . \\nhis latest challenge is his biggest though . . . he \\nmust stop the vampire deacon frost ( played by stephen dorff ) from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires . \\nadmitedly , comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums , often viewed as juvenile by most standards , even seen as illiterate by some . \\njudging by a series of poorly recieved ( financial and critical ) comic book based films ( such as batman and robin , steel , barb wire , the crow : city of angels , and the list goes on ) , one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film . \\nto some degree , i agree with this sentiment . \\nhaving read comic books since the age of nine ( i\\'m 21 right now ) i can count the number of good comic book based movies ( not including japanese manga ) one hand : 1 : the crow ( 1994 ) , 2 : batman ( 1989 ) , 3 : superman , 4 : the mask , and now , #5 , blade . \\n ( \" men in black \" is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book ) \\nwhy is this ? \\nfor the most part , it is because the filmmakers understand \\nthe comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match . \\nthe crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere , which the director provided . \\nthe mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics , which the casting and cg effects reflect . \\nsuperman \\nis not over the top with colour and flash , and the film reflects this . \\nblade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film , creating an appropriate atmosphere . \\nthis is in stark contrast to joel schumacher\\'s contrived vision in batman and robin , reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960\\'s television show . \\nbatman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact : comics have grown up , and so has the audience ( i\\'m working on a scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when i\\'m ready ) . \\nwhich brings me back to blade . \\nalthough he may be a familiar character to some , due to his appearances in the spider-man animated show on fox , one will find no single trace of the warm-and-fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon . \\nthe film depicts a vicious vampire killer that \\nuses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends . \\nthe end results are not pretty by any means . \\nthe story elements work very well -- for a comic book story . \\nscreenwriter david goyer ( who also wrote the crow ) incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore , using science to explain many of the ideas often dismissed in vampire films . \\nthis is presented through karen , a hematologist portrayed by n\\'bushe wright . \\nthis leads to inventive use of standard medical treatments to kill vampires . \\nadd this \\nto the neat little gadgets that blade uses ( including a titanium sword complete with an \" anti-theft device \" ) , and one has an interesting premise . \\nhowever , the film works best as an action film . \\nactor wesley snipes has \\nan extensive background in martial arts ( most of which comes from capoeira , a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks ) , choreographing every single move . \\nproving that quick , flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequences ( see batman and robin for a \\ngood example of that ) , wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes . \\nregardless , this film is far from perfect . \\nthe film suffers from at least one major plot hole , regarding the summoning of the blood god . \\nthe ritual requires that a number of pure blood vampires are standing on \\nmarked squares , yet one of them is viciously murdered , allowing the ritual to pass ( and the murdered vampire is later shown standing on the square ) . \\nobvious continuity errors also surface , especially during a scene where deacon frost takes a drag on his cigarette and is not exhaling it in the next frame ( there is no trace of smoke either ) . \\nmuch of the special effects are not that spectacular either . \\nwhile vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch , other cgi ( computer generated imagery ) effects are almost slapped together , which is surprising when given the amount of time the film was given to be released ( the film\\'s release date was pushed back multiple times ) . \\nscenes with computer generated blood look extremely fake , knocking the believability factor down a few notches ( but then , i\\'m really hard to impress ) . \\nthe film\\'s r rating comes from gory violence , but the lack of \\nrealism made me wonder why it got such a rating ( for realistic violence , \\nwatch \" saving private ryan \" ) . \\nthe overuse of cgi in films has made me yearn for the days of director george romero and makeup wizard rob bottin , both pioneers in the art of gore without extensive use of cgi . \\nstill , scenes involving non-cgi special effects do surface ( and look much more impressive ) , such as one particularly gruesome scene where a vampire tries to use blade\\'s sword without deactivating the \" anti-theft device \" . \\nwesley snipes is the saving grace behind what would have otherwise been a muddled mess . \\nwhile not talking much , he is a grand physical presence , leaving other comic book superheroes in the dust . \\na decent ( by comic book film standards ) storyline also helps . \\n',\n",

) , also alive . \\nthe two go through therapy together , and when getting out , they run into eachother again . \\nwhen james gives her a ride home , they almost get into another accident , and immeadiately afterwards , they go to an unbusy parking lot , and have a little quickie , as they were aroused by the accident . \\nyou wouldn\\'t think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish , but they run into a freaky guy named vaughan ( elias kosteas ) and his crutch-carrying girlfriend , gabrielle ( rosanna arquette ) , who are also into it . \\nvaughan is into living on the edge as they are , but he takes it to another level : he loves to recreate famous car crashes . \\nin one scene , he and a friend , colin seagrave ( peter macneill ) recreate james dean\\'s car crash without any padding or safety belts , and suffer some concussions , but nevertheless get a rush ( and the attention of the police ) . \\nsoon , these five are all having sex with one another , be it straight , gay , or lesbian sex . \\nwhile this is admittingly all a bit comical ( the film is almost like a black comedy ) , the film does do a pretty awesome portrayal of people who\\'s main fetish is living on the edge . \\ni\\'m sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents , but i personally don\\'t see a connection between car crashes and sex . \\nthe main connection cronenberg shows us that both give a definite rush . \\nhis car crash scenes are quick and exciting mini-masterpieces : we\\'re at first not sure if they\\'ll take place , but everytime it looks like it may occur , we gasp . \\nthen when it happens , we hold our breath . \\nthe same thing happens with sex , although not in the same fashion . \\nthese people are merely taking it to another level . \\nthe only problem with the film is that it\\'s a tad redundant . \\na normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour and a half . \\nthis goes on for about 100 minutes , and it just seems a little too long . \\nthe sex and car crashes are far between one another , and the time between them are a tad on the boring side . \\nthere\\'s no characterization , although it could definitely be argued , that hey , it\\'s a porn , and we\\'re not here to sympathize . \\nbut still , they coulda cut it down a bit . \\nbut the film is saved with its presentation , as well as some other elements . \\nthe atmosphere is very dark and forboding , creating a kind of cool weird feeling . \\nand there are several scenes are just amazing . \\none scene has catherine and james having sex , while she softly asks him questions about being with a man , which sounds almost erotic the way she says it . \\na sequence involving one character\\'s death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs . \\nand the final shot is shot perfectly , creating an image of a car crash , and a couple having sex in front of it , despite the fact that she\\'s wounded . \\nthe acting is also pretty good , especially for what is almost a porn ( ousting linda lovelace as best actress in a porn ) . \\nwhile james spader is pretty boring ( he\\'s usually pretty intense ) , deborah kara ungar is amazing . \\nshe speaks all her words in almost zombie-like hushes , and when she\\'s having sex , she has a blank look on her face , not showing the viewer whether she\\'s enjoying it or not . \\nin one scene , she actually looks dead while someone is having sex with her . \\nholly hunter , who gets extra credit just for appearing in something like this , is pretty good , and so is rosanna arquette ( who adds a kinda cool kinkiness to her role ) . \\nbut the film is stolen by elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely that he almost upstages everyone . \\nhe often speaks as he is out of breath , showing a definite affinity for his way of life . \\nhe has a great deal of energy in several scenes , especially one scene where he\\'s taking photographs of a picture , and a later scene where he\\'s getting a freaky tatoo . \\nhe and spader share sexual chemistry in several scenes , foreshadowing a later scene . \\nkosteas is a little known actor ( his biggest role was casey jones in \" teenage mutant ninja turtles \" ) , but here he shows a deniro-like presence , hinting that he\\'s capable of bigger roles . \\nwhile i hardly enjoyed \" crash , \" it\\'s still a pretty intriguing portrayal of a group of people who , if the exist , are some of the strangest and most bizarre people in the world . \\nthese people are able to share a rush between two completely different entities , and the film , which doesn\\'t exactly pain them in a negative light , is sucessful in bringing them to light , even if it leaves the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out . \\ndespite the hardcore nature of the film and the subsequent nc-17 rating ( there\\'s also an r-rated version , but i wouldn\\'t even go near that thing ) , anyone looking for a quick turn-on should just rent a regular porno . \\n',\n",

\\ni could just say it over and over again . \\nsebastian valmont . \\nit kind of rolls off the tongue , in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich . \\nsebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth ; there is no woman he can\\'t have , no material object out of his reach . \\nhe has all the money , all the sex -- all at his fingertips . \\nand , luckily , his parents never enter into his life -- no , in the world of cruel intentions , adults don\\'t really exist . \\nthe ones who do are irritating . \\nsebastian valmont lives with his stepsister , kathryn merteuil ( sarah michelle gellar ) , the bitch-queen of the universe , and also the woman every man wants . \\nsince these two rich kids are so bored , they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons . \\nkathryn wants sebastian valmont to de-virginize cecile caldwell ( selma blair ) , a naive dork-chick who has somehow wronged kathryn . \\nbut it\\'s too easy for sebastian valmont -- he wants to nail annette hargrove ( reese witherspoon ) , the \" paradigm of chastity and beauty . \" \\nso , sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal ( which is too explicit to state here ) . \\nbut -- dear god ! \\n-- sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove . \\ndangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable , and because of its masterful acting . \\ncruel intentions is bad for many reasons , but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting . \\nkathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch , a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her . \\nshe is supposed to be mean , but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons . \\ngellar , while aesthetically pleasing , is one-dimensional and utterly repulsive . \\nwitherspoon has a truly beautiful face , but her character isn\\'t the moral staple she\\'s supposed to be : sure , she won\\'t have sex until she\\'s in love ( is this really a * moral * issue ? ) , but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible . \\nbut i can\\'t forget mr . phillippe , who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable , invulnerable blandness . \\ni have to give him credit and say that he did , in fact , manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions . \\nand there\\'s one point in the film in which he shouts , thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone . \\ntrue , he is bad , but it doesn\\'t help that he has no character to work with . \\nkumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character , leaving us with a sex-crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch . \\nthe film fails in every other way , too . \\nfirst of all , nobody talks like this . \\neven the \" intellectuals \" i know don\\'t bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering . \\nfor a while , the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs , but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there\\'s no way we can join it . \\ncruel intentions also manages to come off as soft-porn in more than one scene . \\nearlier i mentioned a fully-clothed hand-job ; this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont , both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie . \\nso , if we hate them , then what\\'s the point of an extended sex scene ? \\ntitillation , of course . \\nit can\\'t even work under the pretense of \" meaningful love scene , \" because we hate the characters . \\nit\\'s interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons . \\nkumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film ; many of the scenes have a similar tone , and there are moments in frears\\' film that kumble imitates almost completely ( such as the last scene , in which [spoiler warning ! ] the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers ) . \\nbut kids don\\'t act like this . \\nnobody acts like this . \\nin his translation , roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy -- some pretty crucial elements . \\nthe result is a picture of confounding badness , a kiddie-porn mess that thinks it\\'s really deep and profound . \\ni\\'ll give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences , but that doesn\\'t change the fact that it\\'s awful . \\n',\n",

\\ni don't see how , unless , of course , huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time . \\nknock off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go ) , but there's no semblance here . \\nfor instance , van damme is introduced , and then seconds later he's running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong . \\nwhy ? \\nwho knows . \\nwhat are the implications of this ? \\ni have no idea . \\nmost action films abandon depth in favor of action , and this is normally a problem . \\nknock off , however , is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut . \\nthe acting is embarrassingly bad : rochon , in particular , delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity . \\nsorvino , in addition , deserves better than this . \\nvan damme is bad , but he's charming in that bad way , and so i can't say that he's hard to watch ( although i rarely understood what he was saying ) . \\nthe only exception is rob schneider , who is actually quite funny a lot of the time . \\ntsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison . \\nthey're all pointless gimmicks though , such as shots of the inner-workings of a knock off running shoe . \\nbut his action scenes are never boring : one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory ? ) is well-choreographed . \\nlots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy , such as our heroes' first encounter with the rochon character . \\nbut did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous ? \\ni hope he did , for the alternative is a frightening thought . \\nknock off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania . \\nif it were boring , i'd give it zero stars . \\nbut it's not boring : it's loud and excessive and completely incoherent . \\nit's also funny , even when it isn't meaning to be funny . \\na bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesn't deserve to be fully lambasted . \\ni recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness , but i can't deny it's zany , useless charm . \\noh , i know , they're just action scenes looking desperately for a real story , but they're fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts . \\nit's fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this , but that doesn't excuse the fact that it is , indeed , awful . \\n\",\n",

       " b'the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas ? has made the film out to be a comedy , and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one . \\nit\\'s 1971 , and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash-outs , among them journalist raoul duke ( johnny depp ) and his \" attorney \" dr . gonzo ( benito del toro ) . \\nthese two spend most of the film in a drug-induced stupor , having strange hallucinations , trashing their hotel rooms , and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path . \\nduke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas , but gets lost in a blur of drugs , beer , and flying dust , and ends up wandering around with no clue who won . \\nhe leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back , in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate , to cover a drug enforcement conference . \\nfear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs . \\nit doesn\\'t , even in the beginning--while the pair\\'s antics are sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first , the humor here is still fairly dark . \\ndirector terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye , and even when we\\'re laughing , we\\'re laughing at them rather than with them . \\nthey spend most of their time paranoid , angry , or just plain befuddled , which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles . \\nthe black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen , but it\\'s probably not something most other audience members would want to experience first-hand . \\nall this aside , i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one-hour mark , thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off-kilter satire of drug culture . \\nthankfully , the script delivers it before too long , as duke , in a rare moment of lucidity , stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie , \" riding the wave \" of something that seemed special and important . \\nnow it\\'s six years later and the wave has finally broken , as he puts it . \\nmaterialistic culture is still alive and well and , for most of this film , right in his face in las vegas ; the \" american dream \" of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever . \\nthe social protesters have lost , and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment . \\nin many ways , fear and loathing is gilliam\\'s most reality-based film ; all of his others , with the exception of the fisher king , have made use of some sort of fantasy or science-fiction plot elements . \\nyet it is his off-the-wall masterpiece brazil ? to which this film bears the most visual resemblance . \\nthe protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic , soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks , and similarly duke\\'s world is composed of the artificial , empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations . \\nunlike the protagonist of brazil , however , duke is not a particularly admirable figure , and neither is gonzo . \\nduring the latter half of the film , their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse , eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress , while duke , though he doesn\\'t seem to approve , doesn\\'t do anything to stop it either . \\nby the time this scene takes place , they don\\'t seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more ; they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner . \\nduke seems to realize at some level that he\\'s become something he doesn\\'t like , but he\\'s either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change . \\nthis film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience . \\nwhile gilliam may have overdone it in a few places , i think he and his co-writers deserve more credit than that . \\nthere\\'s plenty of substance here , particularly in the second half ; its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the \\'60s and the objects of their rebellion just aren\\'t usually very pleasant . \\nunlike , say , brazil ? or the fisher king , both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment , fear and loathing in las vegas ? shows us someone who\\'s given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs . \\nin its own psychedelic , whacked-out way , it\\'s sad and regretful , but i think it\\'s also a bit of a kick in the pants , a challenge to find an alternative between chemically-induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas-style materialism . \\nindeed , duke himself admits at one point that he\\'s never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them . \\ni\\'m not sure if he\\'s any closer to accepting it by the end or not , but i suspect the audience will get the idea . \\n',\n",
       " b'no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan\\'s harrowing , humorous , horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe\\'s novel about young lad francie brady\\'s ( eamonn owens ) descent into madness in 1960s ireland . \\non one hand , it was difficult for me to become invested in francie\\'s story because he is such an unsavory character , unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) . \\non another hand , i found it difficult to laugh at some of francie\\'s darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick , needy child , having been raised by a drunken father ( stephen rea ) and a suicidal mother ( aisling o\\'sullivan ) . \\non yet another hand , i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his , for lack of a better word , \" bad \" deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them . \\nhowever , the butcher boy\\'s power is undeniable , and the film as a whole is unforgettable--perhaps because it is so disturbing . \\nwhat makes it so unsettling is the francie\\'s overall wink-wink yet matter-of-fact attitude about everything , expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie ( rea again ) . \\nthink heavenly creatures played largely for laughs , and you\\'ll sort of understand . \\nanchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens ; love francie or hate him , you cannot take your eyes off of owens . \\nthe butcher boy truly is a twisted , unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable . \\nin the lobby after the screening , i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was ; i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust , \" that movie was so unfunny ! \" \\n \" i didn\\'t know what to expect . \\nit\\'s like something you chase for so long , but then you don\\'t know how to react when you get it . \\ni still don\\'t know how to react . \" \\n--michael jordan , on winning his first nba championship in 1991 . . . or , \\nmy thoughts after meeting him on november 21 , 1997 \\n',\n",
       " b'few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parker\\'s adaptation of frank mccourt\\'s memoir angela\\'s ashes . \\nmany dismissed it as an humorless , sentimentalized , uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel ; others hailed it as a heartfelt , sincere portrait of the human spirit . \\ni\\'m somewhere in between , leaning strongly towards the latter . \\nit\\'s certainly well-made and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be . \\nbut i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudo-lyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the two-and-a-half hour running time that screams \" i\\'m important ! \" \\nmccourt\\'s book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early 1900\\'s , a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us . \\nas he comments , \" we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty . \" \\nin ireland , frank ( played by joe breen as a small child ) , his 3 brothers , his mother angela ( emily watson ) and his father malachy ( robert carlyle ) get financial help from angela\\'s mother , a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman . \\nshe helps them get a rat-infested apartment and malachy goes looking for a job . \\npositions are scarce and when he does finally find one , he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking . \\nmeanwhile , frank goes to an uptight catholic school , where the instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires . \\ntwo of frank\\'s brothers soon die , crippled by the dreadful living conditions and malnutrition . \\nas if the poverty and the suffering weren\\'t intense enough as it stood , malachy and angela have another baby , worsening the situation further . \\ni imagine this doesn\\'t sound like much of a plot . \\nthat\\'s probably because it isn\\'t one . \\nthese are people . \\nthis is their story . \\ndirector alan parker ( the commitments ) knows how to tell a good story and angela\\'s ashes , despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting . \\nthough the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting , it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue . \\nsupplementing parker\\'s able direction are the engaging , often poignant performances of the leads , some of them seasoned thespians , others relative beginners . \\ncarlyle , the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movie and now to sentimental melodrama , perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character . \\nwe empathize with the guy , but we don\\'t like or admire him . \\nemily watson turns in a heartfelt , sincere supporting performance . \\nit is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats . \\nalso worthy of mention is little joe breen , whose face graces the film\\'s superb poster . \\nit is breen\\'s first feature film and he\\'s extraordinary as young frank . \\nnot unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense , you can peer into the character\\'s soul through breen\\'s sad eyes . \\non the flip side , one thing that could have vastly improved angela\\'s ashes is a more decisive editor . \\nwhile gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery , he and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage . \\nthe first half , especially , could have been trimmed down , bringing the film to a more reasonable running time and doing our bladders a favor in the process . \\nthings pick up at about the halfway point , sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms i accumulated during the opening hour , but i maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker and co . set in the first half was ludicrously unnecessary . \\n * spoiler warning ! \\nskip next paragraph if in suspense ! * \\nthe film\\'s final message is somewhat conflicted , as frankie , in effect , leaves his family famished in ireland while he himself goes back to america . \\nwhat , exactly , are we supposed to make of that ? \\nhis mother doesn\\'t seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her son , as any mother would , but it still seems inconsiderate of him . \\ni haven\\'t read the book , but i\\'m sure that mccourt justifies his actions therein ; therefore , i\\'m suspicious . \\nanother thing that\\'s never made clear in the movie is the meaning of the title , which , i\\'m sure , is also explained in the memoir . \\nif seen as a film onto itself , rather than an adaptation , angela\\'s ashes stands tall . \\ndespite a few minor setbacks , it is a captivating story of people forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the financial ladder . \\n',\n",

       " b'cradle will rock is the latest effort from director/actor tim robbins . \\nwhile he may have had an oscar worthy film back in 1995 ( dead man walking ) , he gets a little overconfident and sloppy here . \\nthe story is confusing , and filled with many subplots , so i\\'ll try my best and explain it as simply as possible . \\nthe film is based on a \" mostly \" true story about a federal theater in the 1930s , that produced a play ( the cradle will rock ) that apparently was offensive to some , so the government shuts it down . \\nit\\'s during the time of the depression , and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs , or are poor . \\nbetween this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots , about those who work in theater , or those associated . \\nalso along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience . \\ntim robbin\\'s just keeps piling on political views , and characters , that we just give up on the film , or in some cases walk out . \\nfor robbin\\'s it may be a nice achievement , but to me it seemed more like a friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue , and fancy outfits . \\ni thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding cast , unfortunately are all uninteresting , except for a few . \\nlet me recap what each important character does , so please bear with me ( it\\'s the least you can do , especially if you were considering seeing this ) . \\ni\\'ll begin with those involved with the play . \\nthere\\'s orson welles ( angus macfadyen ) who of course is the director of the play , the producer john houseman ( cary elwes ) , marc blitzstein ( hank azaria ) the writer of the play , emily watson , a woman who gets her break by playing the main part in cradle will rock . \\noutside the play there\\'s the : ventriloquist ( bill murray ) who wants a relationship with a federal theater clerk ( joan cusack ) , another subplot involving a painter diego rivera ( ruben blades ) who\\'s unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage ( john cusack ) . \\nthere\\'s a few other actresses and actors who have their own stories ( susan sarandon , philip baker hall too name a few ) but those that i mentioned , were the most significant to the story . \\nanyway , most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted , except for emily watson , who does another great job , and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack , who always delivers through thick and thin . \\nnow although most of the film was weak to say the least , there were some nice moments and some involving subjects , but all this is overblown . \\nsure the free speech segment was a nice feature , but not when it becomes repetitive . \\nthe whole film is like this , and it\\'s basically nothing but a headache . \\non the brighter side , tim robbin\\'s direction was masterful . \\nhis camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas anderson\\'s latest magnolia , only smoother in my opinion , but even that can\\'t make a movie that much better . \\nalthough it has it\\'s moments ( not many of them , but they\\'re there ) , cradle will rock stays true to it\\'s title , because the cradle rocked too far and tipped over . \\n',\n",

       " b'richard linklater\\'s \" slacker , \" made in 1991 for a budget of only $23 , 000 , immerses itself in the twentysomething , college-town culture of austin , texas . \\nmost of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning . \\ntheir lifestyle is a sort of passive resistance to the idea that people should go out and actively pursue a career after graduation ; they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy , the pervasiveness of slave morality , the subtle messages in pop culture , and such . \\nask them what they\\'ve been doing lately , and they\\'ll more likely than not reply , \" oh , you know , just hanging out . \" \\nlinklater uses an interesting technique to examine these characters : the camera follows one person for a few minutes , then someone else walks by and the camera follows that person , who walks into a diner just as another person is walking out the door . \\n . \\n . \\n . \\nit\\'s certainly a lot of fun listening to these characters talk : some of them are clearly very intelligent and have some genuinely insightful ideas , some of them are just plain weird , and some of them think their ideas are a lot more profound than they really are . \\nthe opening monologue , delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver , tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering structure of the film . \\nother characters along the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships to the history of anarchist philosophy , while groups of pseudo-intellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around and doing nothing or the subtle bribery-based morality in \" scooby-doo . \" \\nfor the most part , however , the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types . \\nnear the beginning , a paranoid man follows a pedestrian for several blocks , warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming to secret colonization of mars . \\nanother man seems to be collecting televisions , keeping at least fifteen sets running at the same time and playing tapes of a graduate student who recorded himself having a nervous breakdown and destroying the camera . \\nand in a scene that drew a big laugh from everyone present when i saw the film , a man tries to achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge and then throwing a typewriter into the creek below . \\nthe only problem with \" slacker \" is that it starts to run out of steam towards the end . \\nsince linklater only spends a few minutes with each character , the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after a while . \\nthere are only so many times you can hear , \" hey , what\\'s going on ? \" \\n \" not much , what are you up to ? \" \\n \" nothing really , just hanging around , \" before it gets on your nerves ; the film might well have benefited from a slightly slower pace and a little bit more characterization . \\nand the dialogue in the second half of the film is by and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half ; a jfk buff , for example , seems like a pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist , and many of the characters just generally aren\\'t as weird or unique . \\ninstead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal people and then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first , linklater shows us the oddballs first , then stops and reminds us that ordinary people live there too . \\n \" slacker \" is a good film and a wonderfully offbeat and entertaining comedy , whatever its flaws , and its status as a cult classic is well-deserved . \\ni just can\\'t help but think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down a little bit and filmed these scenes in reverse order . \\n',\n",

       " b'labelling is sometimes everything . \\nin original mad max , the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future , thus making it one of the science fiction classics , despite the future world being almost exactly like our own . \\nwalter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors . \\nproducers weren\\'t thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones . \\non the other hand , producers were right on the mark ; walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america . \\nto make the movie even more distant from future , plot was loosely based on anabasis , historical book written by xenophon , greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago . \\ninstead of ancient persia , movie begins in contemporary coney island , where cleon ( dorsey wright ) , leader of the warriors , local youth gang , gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city . \\nthe gathering , organised by gramercy park riffs , most powerful gang in the city , is taking place in bronx . \\nthat is far away from warriors\\' home territory , but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce . \\non the gathering , cyrus ( roger hill ) , charismatic leader of the riffs , announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city . \\ncrowd is enthusiastic , but the small gang of rogues , led by psychopathic luther ( david patrick kelly ) uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus . \\npolice simultaneously raids the gathering , and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing , and their leader gets killed by riffs . \\nthe remaining eight , led by cleon\\'s lieutenant swann ( michael beck ) , must now try to get to coney island , but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs . \\nupon its release , despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it , the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status . \\nhowever , despite being one of the best movies of that year , and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career , the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year . \\nthe reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly . \\nif walter hill\\'s idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america , he failed miserably . \\nthe future was much worse than his vision . \\nthe youth gangs , as presented in the warriors , are far from shadowy armies , able to take over entire cities . \\ntheir members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic , and for the public more annoying , matters like crime . \\nin their vocabulary , word \" arms \" is reserved for small knives and blunt objects , and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns . \\nthey even have their own , very strict and detailed laws , upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own . \\nmany people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors . \\nsome of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour . \\ndespite those objections , the warriors have all the elements of a very good film . \\nthe plot is simple , and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes . \\nthe fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic , although there isn\\'t much bloodshed or gore in the movie . \\nediting is superb , events happen at quick pace , with the exception of middle , when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would-be-girlfriend mercy ( deborah van valkenburgh ) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory . \\nthe soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable . \\nyet , the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent , although most of them later sunk into anonymity . \\nbest known of them is david patrick kelly , whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains . \\nmichael beck as cool , almost statesman-like leader of a gang , is also very good , and james remar gives good contrast as his hot-shot contender for top spot . \\nall in all , this movie is perhaps dated , yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies . \\n',\n",

       " b' \" i know what you did last summer , \" the first high-profile slasher thriller to be released after 1996\\'s \" scream , \" and written by the same screenwriter , kevin williamson , is a stylish , effective horror film that became 1997\\'s biggest hit of the fall season . \\nwhile \" scream \" was a more knowing film about the genre , \" i know what you did last summer \" is more reminiscent of a straight-forward slasher flick , but it is far more intelligent than such bottom-of-the-barrel guilty pleasures as all nine of the \" friday the 13th \" films ( well , okay , \" jason goes to hell \" was pure hell to sit through ) . \\nthe film starts off with four talented , aspiring teenage friends who have just graduated from high school in their small boating town of southport , n . c . \\nit is the 4th of july , and they will soon be heading their separate ways . \\nkind-hearted julie ( jennifer love hewitt ) , and outsider ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) will be headed off to college , while helen ( sarah michelle gellar ) , who has just been honored croaker queen in the town , and her ignorant jock boyfriend , barry ( ryan phillippe ) , are going to new york to become an actress and football player . \\nwhen the four of them travel to a nearby mountain-side beach for the evening , they are dismayed after hitting a man in the road on their way home . \\ndistraught and confused , they decide they can\\'t go to the police because they will be charged with manslaughter , so they devise a plan to throw the apparently dead victim off a peer into the ocean , in hopes no one will find him . \\njulie is apprehensive about it , but is forced into it by barry . \\nswitch to exactly a year later , julie , still unable to come to terms with what she did , reluctantly returns home from college to find that all three of her old friends are still in the town because their career plans did not work out . \\nalmost immediately , julie recieves an ominous letter that simply reads , \" i know what you did last summer , \" and that is the start of their problems as they find themselves being terrorized by a mysterious figure dressed in fisherman gear and yielding a giant hook . \\n \" i know what you did last summer , \" is a successful horror film for a number of reasons . \\nthe cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian , as it put shadows , fog , steam , and other clever devices to add atmosphere to the proceedings . \\nthe characters , particularly julie and helen , are realistically written , and the film amazingly deals with their broken relationship in a few scenes , which is largely uncharacteristic in films of this sort . \\nand last , the film creates a few dazzling and scary set-pieces that are some of the most memorable i\\'ve seen in a horror movie , particularly the suspenseful , superbly shot sequence involving helen at her family\\'s store with the killer inside with her . \\nperhaps the best character is that of missy egan ( anne heche ) , a lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the one julie thinks they hit . \\nheche\\'s performance is a standout , as she is able to create a full character in only about ten minutes of screen time . \\n \" i know what you did last summer , \" could have been a great horror movie if not for a few problems . \\nprinze jr . gives a performance to be desired here , and much of his dialogue sounds wooden coming out of his mouth . \\nalso , the climax of the film almost completely loses its frightening grip after it unveils the mystery killer , who is a decidedly bad actor and should not have been given any lines . \\nluckily , the penultimate scene saves the disappointing finale , which includes an expertly crafted \" jump-in-your-seat \" scare . \\nin the main roles , hewitt and gellar are highly talented , and hewitt , especially , is one of the best screamers i\\'ve ever heard . \\nshe honestly could give jamie lee curtis a little competition for the best \" scream queen . \" \\nand gellar is touching as a young woman who , in the course of one year , finds her dream of being an actress ultimately shattered . \\nalthough not up to the level of either \" scream \" movies , or the more recent , \" urban legend , \" \" i know what you did last summer \" is a respectable , smartly-scripted slasher film that firmly proved good horror movies were once again being made . \\n',\n",

\" , \\nbut \" can she help me get on a lifeboat ? \" \\ndicaprio is a revelation . \\ni hadn\\'t seen him before in anything , and didn\\'t know what the heck to expect , really . \\n ( honestly , i expected a bad irish accent , but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea , so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game . ) \\ndicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive , and being on the titanic , that it\\'s hard not to like him . \\nfrom the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg , dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest , and he never falters . \\nwinslet\\'s character grows up a lot during the movie , and so does her performance . \\nat first , she\\'s not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look drop-dead gorgeous . \\nwe know from the narration that she\\'s monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane , but there isn\\'t any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio . \\nwinslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg . \\nit\\'s at that moment where winslet\\'s character really comes alive . \\nfaced with real danger , she drops her spoiled-rich-girl mannerisms and does a splendid job . \\nas rose and jack race around the doomed ship , looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal\\'s fiery temper , winslet turns in a superb acting performance , mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror . \\nof course , the most interesting character is the ship itself . \\ncameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic , and shows her in every mood -- as a deserted wreck , down in the boiler room , up on the bridge , down in the hold , at the captain\\'s table , down in steerage -- and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead . \\ncameron\\'s greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well . \\n',\n",

       " b'the central focus of michael winterbottom\\'s \" welcome to sarajevo \" is sarajevo itself , the city under siege , and its different effect on the characters unfortunate enough to be stuck there . \\nit proves the backdrop for a stunningly realized story which refreshingly strays from mythic portents ( \" platoon \" ) , racial tumultuosness ( the risible \" the walking dead \" ) or a tinge of schmaltziness ( \" schindler\\'s list \" ) . \\nthe two leads , stephen dillane as a reporter and emira nusevic as an orphan with a plight few can identify with , are extremely believable ; not one moment with them involved rings false . \\nthe question is not what went right . \\nthe question is what went wrong . \\nfor one , the film fails to provide a political overview of the war as it progresses ( the dillane characters reports an american plane departing from sarajevo as it departs , and that\\'s about it . ) . \\nthe assortment of high-profile supporting actors , ranging from woody harrelson as a yankee reporter \" into \" liquor and cigarrettes to marisa tomei as a huggable children\\'s aid or somesuch are incapable of rising above the sketchiness of their characters , albeit they strive . \\nthe interrupted use of authentic war footage somewhat hampers the rest of the film , it makes the fictional characters seem powerless by comparison . \\nstill , winterbottom eschews mawkishness through flashy , frantic editing and imaginative use of music . \\nand it\\'s a plus , because he doesn\\'t toy with our emotions with sentimental blandness . \\nhe wants us to know that in war , no one is victorious . \\nthe sweet hereafter \\nstarring ian holm , sarah polley , bruce greenwood , tom mccamus , gabrielle rose , arsinee khanjian , alberta watson , maury chaykin , caerthan banks . \\nproduced by atom egoyan and camelia frieberg . \\nscript by atom egoyan ( based on the novel by russell banks ) . \\ndirected by atom egoyan . \\nrunning time : 110 mins . \\nrated r . __________________________________________________________ \\natom egoyan\\'s powerfully meditative \" the sweet hereafter \" is as anything as haunting and transcendental as i\\'ve seen this year . \\nit not only explores the aftermaths of a terrible tragedy with magnificent subtlety , with cold , and stunning shots of the backdrop of this mistfortune but also by telegraphing the sense of devastation that has permeated the small town with an enormous amount of dignity and respect for each and every soul affected . \\nian holm as the somber , lonely lawyer seeking compensation for the townspeople , has a decency and a restraint uncommon with lawyers , he\\'s a lion for the wrong reasons : the pain for having lost his daughter ( she\\'s a druggie who frequently calls him begging for money ) is reflected on the town . \\nand in some mesmerizing flashbacks , we witness how she lost her purity . \\nit\\'s one of the most strikingly breathtaking takes on the loss of innocence i\\'ve ever seen . \\nbut the most astounding part goes to sarah polly , the peaceful , benevolent girl who , in contrast to the other characters , remains the most mentally stable during past , present or future . \\nher ability to convey concealed pain and unconditional love is the opposite , yet near-revolutionary role that won emily watson an oscar nomination for \" breaking the waves \" . \\nboth women are torn apart by an extraordinary incident but it is only then that we truly see , truly feel , their wordless , omnipotent love . \\n \" the sweet hereafter \" though , is atom egoyan\\'s movie and as of now , he is emerging as the definite face of independent cinema . \\nafter surging to worldwide recognition with 1994\\'s \" exotica \" , \" the sweet hereafter \" makes him something few people in this industry can call themselves : an artist . \\nhe interweaves time with a delicacy and sees a soul with a purity that is just not common . \\n',\n",
       " b\"curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy , but its humour won't appeal to everyone . \\nto be specific , let me give you an example . \\ndo you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated ? \\nif you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny , don't see curdled . \\non the other hand , if you found that sequence to be pretty funny , you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at . \\nour film's heroine , gabriela , played by angela jones , is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers ; she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles . \\nluckily for her , miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage - her scrapbook is getting pretty big . \\nthe killer's nickname in the press is the blue blood killer , because he preys on older rich socialite women , and he's played by william baldwin ( this is not a spoiler ) . \\none particularly striking m . o . \\non the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims . \\ngabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests . \\nshe immediately quits her job , and signs on with pfcs , which stands for post-forensic cleaning service . \\nno points for guessing what they do . \\nher workmates are confused by gabriela's fascination with murder ; to them , it's just a day job . \\nthere's a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk , and what they would say . \\ngabriela's partner , elena , played by mel gorham , is particularly perturbed by gabriela's wide-eyed fascination , and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killer's latest scene - they're the messiest , you see . \\nunbeknownst to them , the last victim left something on the scene which would id the blue blood killer , so he's also heading over there . . \\nthe comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental - quentin tarantino executive-produced this film , which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival . \\napparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a feature-length film . \\nthere are other parallels - the star of curdled is angela jones ( the top billing goes to william baldwin , but really , jones is the central character ) , who's probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos , the death-obssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction . \\nthat role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film , curdled jr . \\njones is great in curdled - she's wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wide-eyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her character's innocence or likeability . \\nshe can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow . \\nit's a great performance . \\nreb braddock's direction is extremely sharp and clever , toeing the line between black humour and bad taste . \\nthe best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing - any more than that would be a spoiler . \\nthe opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing . \\nof course , it's impossible to really take this stuff seriously , but then again you're not really supposed to - braddock knows the audience is in on the joke , and makes it a fun little romp as a result . \\nthe one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film , and it feels like it ; the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time , and some parts just seem to drag . \\nwhile its running time is already a short 94 minutes , it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing . \\ncurdled seems destined to be a nice cult film for miramax . \\nit'll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well . \\n\",\n",

       " b'i went to blair witch project 2 : book of shadows with the highest of hopes . \\nthe original film , released last summer , was genuinely scary and terrifying ; i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor . \\nunfortunately , my hopes were soon dashed . \\nas the movie opens , the audience is shown pseudo-documentary clips of burkittsville , maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie . \\nit\\'s a mostly humorous , self-aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film . \\nduring this segment , we are introduced to the protagonist , a young man who sells blair witch-related memorabilia from his website . \\nthe movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously . \\nwe see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia , but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies . \\nwe see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him . \\nwe see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room ; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him . \\nno explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution ; in fact , these scenes are barely referred to again . \\ni had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally , a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting , filthy interiors , and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie . \\nthe movie cuts again , this time to the present . \\nthe young man , whose name is jeffrey ( played by jeffrey donovan -- as in the first movie , the character names are identical to the actors\\' names , although this movie admits up front that it is fictional , so there\\'s no reason for the practice this time around ) , is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the \" blair witch hunt , \" which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website . \\nwe meet tristen and steven , a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience . \\nsteven is a skeptic , believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria . \\ntristen , on the other hand , believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence . \\nshe is wan and soft-spoken ; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly . \\n ( she also complains that she feels nauseated ; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant , and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out . \\nhow did i know ? \\nbecause in bad movies , nauseated women are always pregnant . ) \\nthe fourth member of their party is erica , a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch , not evil . \\nthey pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery . \\nkim is dressed completely in black , has extreme goth-style makeup on , and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities , but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch . \\npresumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect ; it\\'s never explained . \\nthe party of five heads off into the woods as promised . \\nthey reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr\\'s house and set up camp , complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night\\'s events . \\nthere is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well , but after a few words are exchanged , the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere . \\nthe movie veers off at this point to spend many long , long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down . \\nsexual innuendoes are tossed around , much hard liquor , beer , and pot is consumed , and nothing much else happens . \\nthis would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary . \\nthe next day , the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed , and that steven and tristen\\'s manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds , like snow . \\nthe videotapes are missing , but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim , they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house , \" right where the original blair witch tapes were found ! \" \\nooh . \\nspooky . \\nthe team goes back to jeffrey\\'s house -- a creepy old civil war-era warehouse in the heart of the woods -- to regroup and review the tapes . \\nthey soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night . \\nwacky hijinks ensue . \\ntristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch , everybody starts finding these weird rune-like burn marks on their bodies , steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations , and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket . \\nthroughout the entire ordeal , jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes , which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps ; eventually tristen wanders in , mutters something about \" reverse , \" and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards . \\nwhen they do this , they discover what really happened during the five lost hours . \\n ( one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes . \\nokay , if the videotapes were being buried , then how were they recording themselves . . . oh , \\nnevermind . ) \\nthis movie was awful . \\nsimply awful . \\nthe characters are broadly-drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development . \\nerica is the nature-loving wiccan . \\ntristen is the weak and sympathetic woman . \\nsteven is the overbearing asshole . \\nkim is the antisocial goth girl . \\nold , tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures . \\nhow do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic ? \\nbecause she\\'s pregnant ! \\nhow do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl ? \\nbecause she wears a lot of eye makeup ! \\nhow do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy ? \\nbecause he has jagged teeth and talks like he\\'s straight out of \" deliverance \" ! \\nthis is weak storytelling at its worst . \\nrather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic , the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics , in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action . \\nit didn\\'t work . \\non top of being poorly developed , most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid . \\n ( \" honey , you just had a miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at a hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie . \\nlet\\'s get on a plane home . \" \\n \" no . \\ni am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and i want to find out what\\'s going on . \" \\n \" ok . \" ) \\nfrankly , by the end of the movie , i was rooting for the witch . \\ni also felt that there was simply too much blood \\'n\\' gore in this film . \\nthe first movie worked by never showing us the horror . \\nthe witch was a palpable presence in that movie , but we never saw it ; we never saw anything , in fact . \\nthe horror was all off-screen , and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be . \\nthis is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie . \\nblair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the gross-out . \\nthis was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey\\'s throat , and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort . \\nknives plunge into flesh , bloody fingers trail off into the darkness , and none of it is explained until the very end , when it was too late for me to care . \\nthis movie didn\\'t stop with showing us the gore , either ; it went for broke and showed us everything . \\nby the end of the movie , there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours . \\nit is all explained ; in fact , it is all shown on-screen in loving detail . \\ni confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster , or see only brief glimpses , mere suggestions of what the monster is ; it is not because i find the monster so terrifying , but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying . \\ni have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no \" monster , \" that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind . \\ni found this to be a miserably poor explanation ; if it was in fact the director\\'s intent , then he needs to have some words with the writer , because it was not made clear at all . \\n ( i know a lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds ; none of them has ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with a group of other people for the next week or so . \\nand if there was no witch , then what about the vanishing tree ? \\nthe snowfall of manuscript paper ? \\nhm ? ) \\nblair witch 2 : book of shadows was a horrible movie . \\nfrom the poorly-written characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the gross-out shots , it was a bad effort through and through . \\n',\n",
       " b'andrew lloyd webber\\'s musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time . \\nwebber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as \" oklahoma ! , \" or the slapstickness of shows like \" a funny thing happened on the way to the forum . \" \\nthey instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics . \\nlike \" jesus christ superstar , \" which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune \" superstar , \" a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn\\'t spread his message wider ) , \" evita \" takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things ) . \\n \" evita \" deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn\\'t like di slept to \" the top \" ) . \\nwebber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it . \\nhere , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad . \\nit\\'s also a musical , with almost no words not unsung . \\nthe film plays like a rock opera , much like their \" jesus christ superstar , \" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one . \\nafter all , this is a musical , and webber\\'s musicals never undermine this . \\nthey are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side . \\nthis is why the beginning of \" evita \" is kind of a let-down . \\nokay , it is a let-down . \\ni\\'m not saying the opening moments are bad , because they\\'re pretty good . \\nbut what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand . \\nin the musical , it\\'s a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , \" buenos aires , \" which is also lifeless . \\nthen a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , \" another suitcase in another hall , \" which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva . \\nthe portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it\\'s being narrated by a hater of eva\\'s , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light . \\nfor a while , it looks like alan parker can\\'t pull it off . \\nhowever , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song \" goodbye and thank you , \" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful . \\nfrom this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical . \\nno more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact . \\nwe see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) . \\nmore importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work . \\njuan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory . \\na muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before . \\n>from the \" goodbye and thank you \" number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation\\'s people downtrodden . \\nbut despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star . \\nthat\\'s when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she wasn\\'t the great woman she really was , and expose her fame . \\ndescribing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he\\'s said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can\\'t help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death . \\nalan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he\\'s done \" fame , \" \" the committments , \" \" bugsy malone , \" and \" pink floyd the wall \" - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is . \\nwe cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented . \\nhis direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is . \\nand there is energy throughout , with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings \" don\\'t cry for me , argentina , \" and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is . \\nmadonna\\'s golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film . \\nat the beginning , she looks like she\\'s too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) . \\nher death , though , is brilliant . \\nher singing could be better though . \\ni know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she\\'s trying to hard . \\nshe sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . . patti \\nlupone - i heard her sing on an old \" evita \" cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) . \\nbut it\\'s generally very good , although not up to the brilliance the role really requires . \\nantonio banderas , who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( i\\'m one of the few people who thinks he rocks ) , is extremely comanding in his performance , presenting a lovable narrator . \\nhis singing is very good , though nothing compared to the original , mandy patinkin . \\nhe does have a pretty good singing voice , and a great range . \\nand jonathan pryce is pretty awesome , although very brief at times , in his role as juan , seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade . \\nalthough it gets off to a rocky start ( \" rocky \" \\'s polite for what it really is ) , it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical . \\nlike the other musical released in \\'96 ( woody allen\\'s \" everyone says i love you \" ) , it\\'s a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead , but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance . \\n',\n",

       " b\"one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction . \\nthe purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun . \\nsometimes the stories are compelling . \\nsometimes they're not . \\nbut , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i've never been bored by any of the enterprise's numerous missions . \\nstar trek : insurrection is no exception . \\nthe film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it's the worst in the series ) , but i'm not really sure why . \\nit's an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film . \\nsome say it's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film . \\nothers say the special effects are cheesy and that it's boring . \\ni simply enjoyed the film . \\ninsurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku ; the ba'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet . \\nof course , these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son'a , led by ru'afo ( f . \\nmurray abraham ) , to mess everything up . \\nthe son'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying . \\nthat's when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba'ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba'ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) . \\nso , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba'ku in their natural habitat . \\nwhen dealing with a series with as much history as this , it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode . \\nthis is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it . \\ninsurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters . \\nstewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together . \\njonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy . \\nfrakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action . \\nthis is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation , and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes , in which the son'a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba'ku planet , the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look . \\nif i have any complaint about the film , it's that it tries to take a moral stance when it's not very appropriate to do so . \\ni don't think it's that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba'ku in order to save the lives of thousands . \\nbetter yet , why couldn't they have co-existed ? \\ninsurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience . \\nwith it's inherent camp factor , the star trek series doesn't seem well-equipped to deal with issues like this . \\ni prefer to just enjoy the spectacle . \\n\",\n",
       " b'since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style . \\nnow , instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow . \\nthis realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993\\'s schindler\\'s list shows . \\nmost of today\\'s mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience . \\nthat\\'s why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol\\' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema . \\nthe movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950\\'s company town of coalwood , west virginia . \\nit\\'s a well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine . \\nthe mine , which is run by homer\\'s father ( chris cooper ) , is not the place for homer , however . \\nafter watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it , \" anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did . \" \\ndrafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast , homer begins to construct rockets . \\nwith the help of their history teacher , miss riley ( laura dern ) , and several mine workers , the four are soon bound for great things . \\noctober sky is a skillfully crafted film , and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston . \\njohnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he\\'s doing here . \\nhe molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust . \\nhe does not push any barriers , but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film\\'s charm . \\nhis finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers , or the silent struggle between homer\\'s mother and father . \\nthe cast is well chosen , although the true bright spots are the supporting roles . \\nlaura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher , giving the boys the support and guidance they need . \\nher role is instantly likeable . \\nchris cooper ( the horse whisperer ) , as homer\\'s father , is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie . \\nhe\\'s definitely a driving force in homer\\'s life , and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable . \\nthe script is generally cheerful , projecting the boys\\' endeavors in a lighthearted manner . \\nthere are moments when it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist . \\nit highlights the essence of youth , however , and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps . \\noctober sky should be a success with audiences . \\nalthough it doesn\\'t have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she\\'s all that , it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards . \\nit\\'s a welcome change to the dramatic genre , and one that everyone should see . \\n',\n",
       " b'it seemed wholly appropriate that at a weekend screening of \" the horse whisperer , \" the start of the film was delayed some twenty minutes due to \" projection difficulties . \" \\nrobert redford\\'s film version of nicholas evans\\' best-selling novel was supposed to have been in theaters last december , going head-to-head with \" titanic , \" but is only now making its much anticipated debut . \\nthis ( strategic ? ) \\ndelay has allowed \" the horse whisperer \" to compete , sans fanfare , against some smaller , unassuming movies during a relatively slower time at the box office . \\nno matter . \\nredford\\'s film stands head and shoulders above james cameron\\'s ocean-going tragedy , especially in the writing and acting departments . \\nwhatever the reasons for its postponement , \" the horse whisperer \" supports the old adage \" better late than never . \" \\nredford has taken evans\\' book and given it the big screen treatment . \\nwhile parts of \" the horse whisperer \" are epic in scope and vision , especially the aerial \" travelogue \" that maps out this great country of ours , its real strength lies in the subtleties it uses to paint the fragile alliance between man and beast . \\nwhen her daughter , grace , is involved in a terrible riding accident , hard-driven fashion editor annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) devotes herself to rehabilitating both grace and grace\\'s beloved horse , pilgrim . \\nrefusing to have the hideously disfigured animal put down , annie researches every possible source of information about equine cures before discovering an article about a faith-healing cowboy of sorts called tom booker ( redford ) , who has a way with horses and , perhaps , with people too . \\nundeterred by tom\\'s initial reluctance to get involved , annie drives grace and a sedated pilgrim across country to meet him , and finally persuades tom to work with the uncontrollable animal . \\nredford\\'s film unfolds slowly and lovingly , echoing the patience required in healing both physical and psychological wounds . \\nthe film\\'s a little long and , even if you haven\\'t read the book , it\\'s pretty obvious where it\\'s heading--but these are minor complaints . \\nredford and thomas are strong and convincing as the couple drawn by a mutual affection for the great outdoors and each other , but it\\'s scarlett johansson as grace who shines in a more difficult role . \\ndianne wiest , chris cooper ( \" lone star \" ) , and sam neill--better than i\\'ve seen him before--round out the respectable supporting cast . \\nand the director\\'s respect for horses is clearly in evidence . \\none word of warning , however : while brilliantly shot , the accident scene , involving an out-of-control truck , is extremely disturbing . \\nredford\\'s canvas is huge and exquisite . \\nhe doesn\\'t hesitate to incorporate vast , sprawling vistas of the american northwest : spectacular , snow-capped mountain ranges , azure skies , and shimmering fields of wheat--all are resplendent in cinematographer robert richardson\\'s viewfinder . \\nveteran english composer john barry was originally signed to score the film but left the project which is a pity , since \" the horse whisperer \" is \" dances with wolves \" by way of \" out of africa \" ( oscar winners both for barry ) . \\nfortunately , barry\\'s replacement , thomas newman , contributes a fine score that nicely balances the majesty of montana with the delicate , human conditions--sonorous , string-laden passages that swell with pride playing counterpoint to more poetic , introspective movements ripe with nuance . \\n \" the horse whisperer \" is that rare kind of movie : it looks good , it feels good , and by golly it does you good . \\nthe wait , it turns out , was well worth it . \\n',\n",

surprisingly heartbreaking one , which is why it\\'s such a good novel , and why this is such a good film . \\nthe story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a . k . a . lolita is great because it\\'s not trash for the perverted but because it\\'s about human obsession with things that are out of one\\'s reach . \\nits protagonist , the comically-named humbert humbert , is not your average pedophile , but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies . \\nthe character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology , something that will destroy us but that we can\\'t live without . \\nthese ideas are all worked into this film nicely , but done in a way that is not heavy-handed at all , but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating . \\nthe focus of this film , and the reason for making it , it seems , was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images , and scenes which are blatantly over-stylized . \\nthe tone of the book is a comical one , but it\\'s also a tragic one , and humbert , telling the story from his perspective , blows every single thing out of perspective . \\nhumbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires , and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed . \\nwe get a sense that perhaps it\\'s by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed . \\nhe weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14-year-old love , and allows himself to embody her as lolita . \\nhe lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions , and by the end , he has nothing but overly-dramatic feelings for her . \\nthe story recognizes the extreme of this , almost out of a test , seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert , and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author , vladimir nabokov , wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions , and perhaps bring them to peace . \\nthe weirdest thing about this film is that by the end , when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey , we can easily sympathize and even identify with him . \\nthe opening and final images of the film are the same , and who hasn\\'t done a similar action , that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us ? \\nthis is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen , the first time being filmed in - shock - 1962 , by stanley kubrick , who couldn\\'t possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do , but did the next best thing : he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general . \\nin that film , he used the traps of society as benefits . \\nthe studio demanded the final scene , that of a heinous murder , come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile . . . and \\nwhen you see it , it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession . \\nthe censors wouldn\\'t allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the , um , relationship between humbert and lolita , so kubrick decided to play it as comedy , but still allow the tragedy to seep through . \\nlooking at these two versions , especially after reading the novel ( and we all know that when we\\'ve read a novel and see a film adaptation , we are bound to be angered by any size differences ) , it\\'s really impossible to compare them . \\nthey both go for different things , and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was . \\nand although it\\'s true that several scenes are similar , and are thus up for comparison , overall it\\'s unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse . \\ni have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is , and i won\\'t say that here . \\nhowever , this film is pretty amazing , mostly because hey , i loved the book , and this film nearly reminded me of it . \\nit doesn\\'t have nearly as much wit ( a couple comical scenes , and even a lot of good chuckles , but just not totally witty ) , but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had . \\nsome of that is in the casting of the two leads . \\njeremy irons , with his deep , soft british voice and gentle look , is an amazing humbert . \\nhe\\'s droll in a very unique way , and , well , no one can look distraught the way he does . \\nhe brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience . \\nand when he looks at lolita with love , and she looks at him with lust , you know that he\\'s her prisoner for as long as he lives . \\nand dominique swain , who plays the title character , is rather incredible . \\nshe pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original , wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction , bratiness , and self-centeredness that marks the character . \\nit\\'s easy to see why she surrenders to humbert : she loves the attention , and knows that she can have her way with him at any time . \\nwhen he denies her something , she blackmails him effortlessly ( a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic ) , and when he stands up to her , she weeps and runs away , leaving humbert to follow her . \\nthere are two other minor characters in the film , one who\\'s a road block in the beginning , and the other who\\'s a reappearing threat to the relationship . \\nthe former is charlotte , lolita\\'s mother , played by melanie griffith . \\nin the book , charlotte is a monster of a woman : overbearing , constantly scolding her child , overly-religious , and ultimately selfish . \\nand she\\'s the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal , at least in the beginning . \\nas played by shelly winters in the original , she represented all these qualities ; as played by griffith here , she\\'s about half of them . \\nit\\'s annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first . \\nand even though griffith is not really bad , persay , she\\'s nothing more . \\nthe other is clare quilty , the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita , and succeeds , but at a price . \\nlangella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original . \\nquilty was a comic character in the original : a threat in the form of many forms , popping in states of rambling , german , proning , and eventually drunk . \\nlangella takes the other route , allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed , and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots , and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending , the exact opposite of what we thought of him . \\nas you can see , most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter , stephen schiff , but just parts of a whole new look at the novel , at least cinema-wise . \\nthis version is beautiful , and perpetually saddening . \\nthe camera movements are stylized , and each shot is breathtakingly rich . \\nthe acting is for the most part wonderful , and when we watch it , we really get a sense that for humbert , who is telling the story , the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita . \\nmore importantly , it takes us right up the brink of emotion , then jumps right over it . \\nby the end , with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car , following what he says is the only part of his life he doesn\\'t regret , we feel that we all lose to something we can never have . \\n',\n",
       " b'in \" gia \" , angelina jolie plays the titular character , the first so-called supermodel . \\nand right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome ( in my eyes , anyway ) . \\ni just don\\'t see how the life of a model is worthy of a two hour film . \\ndespite this , i kept an open mind when i began watching the movie . \\nsadly , though , my fears were realized . \\nit\\'s just not possible to make an interesting , full-length film about a person who spends their days wearing different clothes . \\nthe movie follows the rise and fall of gia ( no last name ) , a tumultuous woman who doesn\\'t particularly enjoy the world of fashion . \\nshe becomes famous more quickly than she can handle , and finds herself hooked on drugs and on a woman she cannot have . \\nthe last hour of the film is just one scene after another of gia getting high , losing a job , and going into rehab . \\nthis formula is repeated several times , and i really got tired of it . \\nin general , i tend to dislike movies featuring heavy drug use . \\nno because it offends me or anything like that ; it just bores me . \\nquite frankly , i don\\'t see the appeal , so when a director shows me a point-of-view shot of a junkie , complete with tipsy camera angles and echoing voices , i am left somewhat unimpressed . \\nthe first hour of the film , though , was actually quite engaging . \\nwe see gia as she is discovered and moves to new york with her boyfriend . \\nthese early scenes were interesting . \\nwe\\'re shown the fashion world through a newcomers eyes , and it was a perspective i hadn\\'t seen before . \\nthe movie begins to go downhill , however , once gia becomes an established model . \\n>from that point , i lost all interest in the movie and was counting the minutes before it would end . \\nit all seemed so excessive . \\nfine , so gia had a drug problem , does this really need to dominate the film ? \\ncouldn\\'t the same effect have been had with a five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting with drugs ? \\nor perhaps this film is meant to be a warning to aspiring models not to get into the drug world . \\nquite possibly , although since i have no desire to become a model , this warning is lost on me . \\nas i stated at the beginning of this review , i simply don\\'t see how the life of a model is worthy of a feature-length motion picture . \\nwhat do they do that warrants a movie ? \\nstrut their stuff for thousands of dollars an hour ? \\ni suppose the same could be said about making movies about baseball players , for example , but at least somebody like lou gehrig led an interesting life . \\ngia did not . \\nand by the end of the film , all i knew about gia for sure was that she hated modelling , was bi-sexual , and was heavily into drugs . \\nnot exactly a meaningful contribution to society , as far as i\\'m concerned . \\n',\n",
       " b'the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie ( if you don\\'t count neil simon\\'s biloxi blues ) . \\nyear after year , more predictably cliched military movies come out -- most recently sgt . \\nbilko -- and none of them ever manage to be anything more than a rehash of the last . \\ni thought stripes would be different . \\nwith ivan reitman as director , bill murray as star and harold ramis as co-star and co-screenwriter , it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army . \\ninstead , it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army . \\nmurray , about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs , plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success , and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him . \\nso he does , and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell , head-shaving and marching/singing sequences , more mind-numbingly stale here than ever . \\nthe characters are even less original , ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette . \\nall the big name stars in stripes ( and even larroquette ) fall victim to the lame , rehashed material and are never really likeable , murray in particular . \\nhe only gets a few decent lines in , although those barely-funny one liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters . \\nhe was even better in caddyshack , for crying out loud . \\nas with a lot of the late 70\\'s / early 80\\'s comedies , stripes is a completely juvenile movie only a child would like but is so sex- obsessed no child should be able to watch it . \\ni\\'m sure it seems funny on paper to have candy pay over $400 to mud wrestle five beautiful women , but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition \" dear god ! \" \\nevery few seconds . \\nstripes isn\\'t the playful kind of sex comedy , either . \\nmost of the time it seems downright misogynistic , as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the women\\'s showers or murray lifts a female m . p . \\nonto the stove and , with an i-know-what-you-like look on his face , says he\\'s going to give her the \" aunt jemima treatment , \" which means shoving a spatula under her butt repeatedly . \\nyou don\\'t want to stick around as the scene progresses and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region . \\n \" i\\'m not enjoying this , \" the woman protests . \\nmy sentiments exactly . \\n',\n",
       " b'a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . \\nfirst , there\\'s the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . \\nbut occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . \\nno no . . . \\njust kidding . \\nhad you going there for a moment , didn\\'t i ? \\nin all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . \\nthe first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it\\'s 5 billion inhabitants ) . \\nthe mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . \\nunfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . \\nthe first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . \\ni\\'d even go so far as to say that many folks who didn\\'t know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . \\nthe writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn\\'t try to overachieve . \\nthere were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . \\nand , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . \\nmortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . \\nshao khan has decided that he\\'s going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . \\nthereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . \\none gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought \" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . \" \\ntoo bad they didn\\'t simply stick with the formula from the first movie . \\ni could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : \\n * the acting is truly bad . \\nsandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . \\n * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i\\'ve * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . \\nin the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . \\ni generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim \" tiny \" lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite \" utility \" actors but he\\'s so totally wrong for this part that he doesn\\'t even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . \\n * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . \\n * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . \\nfor these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . \\n . . . unless you\\'re a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . \\nin that case , the following critiques also apply : \\n * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . \\nwilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . \\nhess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . \\n * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . \\nsonya does her \" kiss of death , \" jax does his \" earthquake , \" liu kang does his \" animality , \" and so on . \\na big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . \\n * there aren\\'t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . \\nsilly , silly folks . \\nand the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . \\nlame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . \\n * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their \" animalities . \" \\nmotaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . \\nfor folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 . \\nyou\\'ll probably like it , but not nearly as much as you liked the first one . \\n',\n",
       " b'john von neumann , progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project , pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos , even without recourse to faster-than light travel . \\nyou send out self-replicating robot ships which explore and radio back information . \\nit may take decades , centuries , or millennia , but it can be done with achievable technology , and doesn\\'t require a magical faster-than-light drive . \\nin the fifties , british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it ; any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer , which would then engage in a real-time dialog with the aliens , exchanging information and technologies , and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned . \\nabout thirty-five years ago , the bbc contracted with astronomer/writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini-series called a for andromeda . \\nafa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission , the construction of a huge computer , the computer\\'s analysis of life on earth , and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication . \\nshe was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then-unknown julie christie . \\naudience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel , andromeda breakthrough , which played to equally high ratings . \\ndennis feldman , whose previous credits include the golden child , has never been noted for coherent , well-structured movie scripts ; they start out great , and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action , mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl . \\nfeldman writes good scenes , but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie , even with a previous version to use as a model . \\nnow , in species , we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline , derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter , gore , and chases . \\nspecies features ben kingsley , who is completely wasted in a badly-written portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist . \\nforest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script . \\nthe species story is relatively simple ; we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since 1971 , and have been receiving answers for two years . \\n ( note that , in the 1970\\'s , we really didn\\'t know diddly about the human genome structure , and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings . \\neven today , all we can do is give information about dna and how it works , not a copy of human dna , because we don\\'t have it analyzed yet . ) \\nthe answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race , and doctor xavier finch , played by ben kingsley , is placed in charge of the attempt . \\nthe script begins to go off the deep end at this point , when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shape-shift into any of several ugly alien life forms . \\nthe first half of the film has something to offer , as \" sil , \" the alien girl , struggles with her multi-form existence , changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again , all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos . \\nshe seems oddly knowledgeable about human society , with glaring gaps where her social skills should be . \\nher instincts are to mate and procreate , and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area . \\nescaping from her birth laboratory in utah , sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her . \\nshe goes on an eating binge , spins herself a cocoon , and emerges as an adult , played by natasha henstridge , who goes a long way toward re-creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960 . \\nthe pursuers : michael madsen is an assassin/exterminator ; forrest whitaker is a convenient empath/psychic , just as though the u . s . government actually had such people on call . \\nneither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided . \\nwhitaker\\'s role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek : the next generation\\'s \" counselor cleavage . \" \\nthe other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina . \\nkingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals , too good to not work to the best of their abilities ; but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland , and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak . \\nh . r . giger\\'s design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it , although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly . \\nthe main fault of species is lack of originality ; it starts out with a wonderful , albeit borrowed , premise , and then doesn\\'t live up to it . \\nall we get are chase scenes and a few nice sex scenes , with a few monsters tossed in . \\nthere is no buildup of tension and suspense , no climax worthy of the name ; species is just a sequence of \" scare \" scenes stuck together . \\nthe movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes , but not rescued by them . \\non the other hand , as an exercise in sci-fi action/ adventure , it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd . \\nspecies earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board , but by and large , it\\'s fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing . \\nmy personal rating is three stars , but knock one or two of those off if you don\\'t enjoy pretty unclothed ladies and bloodthirsty alien monsters . \\nmpaa classification : r ( violence , gore , nudity , sex , language ) \\nstars : ben kingsley , michael madsen , forest whitaker , alfred molina , marg helgenberger , natasha henstridge directed by : roger donaldson produced by : frank mancuso jr . and dennis feldman typed by : dennis feldman cinematography : andrzej bartkowiak music : christopher young run time : 108 minutes aspect ratio : 2 . 35 : 1 from mgm , opens 7 july 1995 \\n',\n",
       " b'with the success of the surprise hit alien , directed by ridley scott , a sequel was inevitable . \\nin fact , after watching the first film , a sequel was wanted , particularly by this reviewer . \\nhanding over the director\\'s chair to recent box office gem james cameron , who had only made two films previous to this one ( pirahna ii , a surprisingly dull film , and terminator , making cameron a household name ) , the alien series got a face-lift of immense proportions . \\ninstead of being a suspense/science fiction film , cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture . \\nwhat results is one of the most terrifying films ever created . \\na film like aliens comes along only once in a while , and when it does , audiences are usually unprepared for it . \\ni never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have . \\nthe terror and fright must have been unimaginable , most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear . \\naliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen . \\nwith a science fiction plot , cameron gives aliens added testosterone , pumping up the action and fire power from the original film . \\nin fact , aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original . \\nperhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero--or heroine , as the case may be . \\nnever have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film , and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character . \\nsigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about . \\nplacing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual , but because of weaver\\'s presence , a woman is the only suitable hero . \\naliens begins 57 years after alien ended . \\nlieutenant ellen ripley ( weaver ) is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened . \\nshe explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens , but \" the company \" is doubtful . \\nthey explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left . \\ndespite stern warnings from ripley , the company remains rigid and won\\'t call the families back . \\nhowever , when the company loses contact with the colony , ripley\\'s story seems much more feasible . \\none of the company\\'s directors , carter burke ( paul reiser ) , wants to gather a team to travel to the planet . \\nthis team includes a buff private vasquez ( jenette goldstein ) , a questionable corporal hicks ( michael biehn ) , and a loyal android bishop ( lance henriksen ) . \\nburke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony . \\narriving on the planet , the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon-type environment . \\nthe only survivor is 12 year old rebecca \" newt \" jorden ( carrie henn ) . \\nripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become , and she becomes newt\\'s surrogate mother . \\nripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened , and soon , all hell breaks loose . \\naliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott\\'s version , it also multiplies the number of aliens in general . \\nalien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member , except ripley , who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo . \\naliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens , and as a result , the chills are incredibly heightened . \\nthen again , this is james cameron , the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2 : judgment day . \\nhe is the best action director out there ( topping renny harlin , who directed cliffhanger ) , and only he could create something as terrifying as this film . \\nit seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes , and aliens has the motherload . \\nwith perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film , aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion . \\ni can\\'t recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout , never dropping for a moment . \\njust when you think the movie is over , something else will occur , and it starts right back up again . \\nwith a seemingly endless conclusion , aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history . \\nthis scene is usually the one remembered most from the film , as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen . \\nusing flawless special effects , the climax is exhausting , leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety . \\nof course , for a film of this genre to work properly , the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see . \\naliens is completely realistic , even a decade after its initial release . \\nthe special effects are wonderfully seamless , with a terrifying alien to go with them . \\none of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music , composed by cameron-regular james horner . \\nhorner has created a terrific score , receiving an oscar nomination for his work . \\nnot only that , horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film , or science fiction film ever ( and that includes 2001 : a space odyssey , which was mainly a compilation of well-known composers ) . \\nin fact , the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music . \\nthe production design is incredible , which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy . \\ndark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive , but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well-lit locations . \\nnormally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer ; aliens uses lights to scare the viewer . \\nthen , of course , is the cinematography , which uses point of view shots , along with video feeds in order to build suspense . \\nsome of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley . \\nsurprisingly , the acting is not only above average for this genre , but some of the best . \\nsigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley , incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard-edged persona . \\nweaver soars above the rest in this film , but she is supposed to . \\ncarrie henn gives an above average performance for a child , developing a three-dimensional character from her quiet attitude . \\nlance henriksen is terrific as bishop , showing that androids don\\'t always have to be flat characters . \\njenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role , and steals several scenes of her own ( though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn\\'t fighting ) . \\nmichael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film . \\nhowever , biehn does a good job , making it seem original again . \\npaul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director , but reiser manages to pull it off quite well ( however , i still see him as paul on tv\\'s \" mad about you \" ) . \\na very good cast ( which also includes bill paxton and william hope ) highlights this action film , making it stand out from others . \\naliens is rightfully rated r for violence , gore , language , and terror . \\naliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre , as alien was more of a suspense/horror film . \\naliens pumps up the stakes , and cameron directs it with professional quality . \\ncameron certainly knows how to make a good action film , but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific

       " b\"i'm a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson's work . \\nhe always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain . \\nwith teaching mrs . tingle , his directorial debut , williamson has reached the end of his rope . \\nwhat used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here . \\nthe components are all there , including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to . \\nbut where are the thrills ? \\nthe laughs ? \\nboth are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge . \\nand what a shame that is . \\ni loved the scream films - heck , i even enjoyed the sci-fi goofiness of the faculty . \\nkevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office . \\nteaching mrs . tingle , a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers , may put an end to his reign . \\nor perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties . \\ni still have my faith , but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past . \\nthe title character of his pet project is a vicious , uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over-the-top by british actress helen mirren . \\nmrs . tingle is basically every student's worst nightmare : a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard-working of her pupils . \\nthe principal ( michael mckean ) is horrified of her , and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members . \\ni enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way . \\nmirren's performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink . \\nin other words , it's a poor substitute for williamson's best work . \\nthe plot is a big problem here . \\nmaterial that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director . \\nthe likable katie holmes plays leigh ann , an over-achiever hoping to get a college scholarship . \\nbut typical mrs . tingle says her history project , which she worked on for countless hours , is laughable . \\nlater on while studying in the gymnasium , a classmate ( barry watson ) offers her a photo-copied duplicate of mrs . tingle's final exam . \\nleigh ann's best friend ( marisa coughlan ) encourages her to use it . \\nalas , the old hag herself finds the three scheming , and snatches the test , and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning . \\nin the morning . . . \\nhow convenient ! \\nthe three students head to mrs . tingle's house , attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann's name . \\nthings get out of hand , and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle . \\nthe plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her . \\nof course , not everything goes entirely to plan . \\nbesides pointless sub-plots involving the football coach ( jeffrey tambor , horribly wasted ) , there is little by way of actual progress . \\nthere is no urgency to the situation ; little tension or laughs are involved . \\nthe humor is completely inconsistent . \\nafter many of the jokes , the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze . \\nyou continue to await some momentum in the story , something that could possibly revive the slow pace . \\na moment like that never arises . \\nwilliamson also does a handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players , including the talented mckean and larry sanders' vet tambor . \\nand the beautiful vivica a . fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor , and then williamson disposes of her character entirely . \\non the plus side , holmes and coughlan are admirable ( with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression ) , and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher . \\nwhile everything is pretty lifeless , teaching mrs . tingle remains watchable . \\nthere are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again , but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script . \\nmirren is easily the best reason to keep watching . \\nshe is convincingly evil and fun to watch , but even her gifted delivery can't save individual scenes that flounder in boredom . \\nif there is one word for the movie surrounding her , it would be `disappointing' . \\nbasically , kevin williamson is his worst enemy here . \\nhis uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated ( not that his writing here is especially good ) . \\nwe will see , when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas , whether williamson is for real . \\n\",\n",

       " b'scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well . \\nduring a film-class discussion , windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are , and why sequels never live up to the originals . \\na few rare exceptions are noted , but they left out one . \\n . \\n . \\nscream 2 ! \\n1996\\'s surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america ! \\na sequel was unavoidable , but luckily the re-teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment . \\nin fact , at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream , i would say that scream 2 might even be the better film ! \\nsidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro , ca in the original scream , is now two years older and off to college , majoring in theater . \\nmeanwhile , tv journalist gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who covered the murders in the first film , has since written a book about the dreadful events ; a book titled \" stab \" , which has been developed into a major motion picture . \\nas scream 2 opens , a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of \" stab \" , and before long , a young couple are butchered to death , unnoticed in the midst of hysteria . \\nthis marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown \" copycat \" sets out to repeat what\\'s been done . \\n . \\n . \\nand finish what hasn\\'t ! \\nof course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film , and yes , movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he/she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds , but this * is * a sequel , and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies . \\nthis is in large part due to williamson\\'s deliciously written script , which will easily leave you satisfied . \\nas much as the film condemns the use of cliches , it is riddled with them , but it is done so effectively , and with skillful direction by craven , that you\\'re not bound to complain . \\ni will note , however , that the \" whodunit ? \" \\ndid wind up being the first person i suspected , but believe me , i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie . \\nall the actors outdo themselves here . \\nwe\\'re not talking oscar performances , but cambell , cox , david arquette as dewey riley , and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing . \\nthe characters remain true to their roots , and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years . \\nwe can see how the events in the first film has affected them , but we don\\'t lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place . \\nthe nice thing about scream 2 is that it doesn\\'t seem off-kilter from it\\'s predecessor . \\nit\\'s a natural , smooth , and believable ( as far as horror films go ) transition from film to film . \\nwe skip two years , but there doesn\\'t seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks . \\nit flows so well that you feel more like you\\'re reading chapter two of a book ( long chapters , eh ? ) \\nthan just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces . \\nwhile main characters are usually the only connection in sequels , scream 2\\'s entire plot structure correlates * completely * with the first , making for immediate fondness and absorption . \\nas i said before , scream 2 easily lives up to , if not surpassing , it\\'s precursor . \\nthe only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it was the first . \\nthis doesn\\'t mean that it overcasts the unique , whimsical humor or overall caliber of it\\'s sequel , it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it\\'s own while maintaining it\\'s sought-after qualities . \\nif ever a film followed it\\'s original so well , it would be scream 2 , and it makes this a definite must-see for all those unbridled scream fans out there . \\nscream 2 fits snugly alongside scream , and will hopefully receive as many high remarks . \\nit would top off the series quite well , if it weren\\'t for the fact that two movies don\\'t really make a series . \\nit\\'s unlikely to assume that a scream 3 won\\'t appear in the next few years , but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror-trilogy , let\\'s hope they can keep up the fantastic work . \\nlike they say , don\\'t mess with perfection . \\n . \\n . \\nbut when a money-making smash-hit is almost guaranteed , who\\'s gonna listen ? \\n',\n",

       " b\"one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable . \\nyou know , the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information , and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is . \\nsure , it's been used over and over , but for some reason , it is always fun to watch . \\nthis cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun . \\none of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story . \\nthis rule applies highly to kiss the girls . \\nthere is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made . \\nhowever , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through . \\nwell , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up . \\nunfortunately , one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits . \\nthat may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was waiting for him to appear on screen , which spoiled the mystery . \\nhowever , credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film . \\nplotwise , kiss the girls shows almost no originality . \\nwe are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forensic psychologist , and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero . \\nhe gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself . \\nobviously cross succeeds at getting the gun , but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene . \\nat his house , cross is told that his neice , naomi ( gina ravera ) , has been missing for four days . \\nthis provides the motivation for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we can't sympathize with detective cross . \\nhowever , what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees . . . \\nbefore she is abducted . \\ndr . kate mctiernan ( ashley judd , the actress of the judd family ) is a smart , athletic woman , and because of these traits , becomes a target for casanova--what the serial killer likes to call himself . \\nbecause of these character-developing scenes , we care for mctiernan , making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful . \\nafter being abducted , mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods . \\nremembering that the killer gave her certain rules , she decides to break one of them by calling out . \\nwhen casanova comes to punish her , she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall . \\nafter she is found , she begins to help cross find his neice . \\nfrom this moment on , kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film , as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive . \\nmany people will compare this film to 1995's seven , another killer film starring morgan freeman , but i presume that the similarities are intentional . \\nthe screenplay , by david klass , is adapted from the novel written by james patterson , and yet i don't quite see how this story could have worked in novel form . \\nwhat makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness . \\nthe cinematography , by aaron schneider , is reminiscient of seven , and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us . \\nsometimes a simple shot is the best one . \\nhowever , many of the shots are stunning , and unlike seven , most of them take place during the day , in sunlight . \\nthe scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done , in more than one way . \\nthe camera work is terrific , but the editing makes this scene work so well . \\nthe chaotic and mtv-type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness , exactly what judd's character is experiencing . \\nhowever , the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors . \\nmorgan freeman is one of today's most powerful and believable actors . \\ndetective cross is a very good character for him , although it is just a similar one to the character in seven . \\nbecause of freeman's powerful presence , he carries half the film by himself . \\nthe other half is carried by ashley judd , one of today's most promising dramatic actresses . \\nin fact , her performance is better than freeman's , if that is even possible . \\nher character is more original than freeman's , and she handles it wonderfully . \\nwe finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream . \\nthe supporting cast is highly underdeveloped , but the cast members do as much as they can with it . \\ncary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina , and unfortunately has scraps for a character . \\ntony goldwyn fairs slightly better , but we don't really get to know his character either . \\ngina ravera gives a good performance , but again she isn't in many of the scenes . \\nso as a result of all these small supporting parts , the weight of the film lies on the two leads , and they do a phenomenal job . \\nsome of the best acting of this genre , and some of the best acting of the year . \\ntwo other essential aspects of the film are quite good . \\ndirector gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors , but the second half of the film loses believability , especially during the revelation of the killer . \\nhe also doesn't handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have , losing a lot of tension during many scenes . \\nhowever , to his credit , he does manage a terrific first half . \\npart of the blame falls on david klass . \\ni'm sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more , but klass focuses on the two main parts . \\nwhile this may give the two leads more screentime , many of the small characters are one-dimensional , and the killer , when revealed , is extremely implausible . \\nthanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel , kiss the girls always seems intelligent . \\nnone of the conversations are laughable , and all move the plot forward without seeming forced . \\none of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer . \\ni blame this mainly on the casting director , because the killer's motive is because of rejection from women ( or so i assume from the opening monologue ) , but the killer himself is very attractive ( one of my friends is a , shall we say , big admirer of the killer ) . \\nkiss the girls is rated r for terror , violence , language , and suggested sex . \\nwith all the implausibilities of this film , and with the mediocre second half , kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain . \\nin fact , i had the urge to see it again just for the performances . \\nthe cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone , and the script is usually smart . \\nthis is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through . \\nmorgan freeman is possibly today's most convincing actor , and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt . \\ni must also say that i loved the ending . \\nthe showdown between good and evil was quite tense , and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer . \\nperhaps it may not be possible , but most of the film isn't anyway . \\n\",\n",
       " b'first , i am not a big fan of the x-files tv series . \\ni have nothing against it particularly , i just don\\'t happen to watch it . \\nhaving said that , i can now say that i liked the x-files pretty well . \\nfor us non-fans , there\\'s nothing big going for it , but there are a lot of little things . \\nthe movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35 , 000 b . c . \\ntwo proto-humans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside . \\nthe alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien . \\nthe movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy ( lucas black , from sling blade ) is captured by the same black ooze . \\nwe then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder ( gillian anderson and david duchovny ) , who have been pulled off of their previous assignment ( investigations into the paranormal ) and put onto the bomb squad detail . \\na caller has threatened a federal building in dallas , texas . \\non a hunch , mulder checks out the building across the street , and , wouldn\\'t you know it , he turns out to be right . \\nthe fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse . \\nfive people die in the blast , and when mulder learns who the victims were , a light bulb goes on over his head . \\nthe two agents team up to investigate , against fbi orders , the links mulder has made . \\ntheir search leads them back to the north texas cave , all across the country , and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to \" the truth . \" \\nthe plot , and \" the truth , \" are uninspired . \\ni got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me . \\nit didn\\'t . \\nthe possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them . \\nbut the point of the x-files is not what the truth is , but the extent to which it has been hidden . \\nit\\'s a slightly more interesting angle , but it still raises expectations about that \" truth \" too high . \\nif this were the whole film , i would say the movie was mediocre , perhaps even boring . \\nbut there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it . \\nthe pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest . \\nbefore the audience can get tired of one location , the agents follow a hot tip to another location , and so on and so forth . \\nthe locations are not all computer-generated sets , either . \\nthere are some artificial settings , but the desert night of nevada , the edge of suburbia in texas , and the endless fields of snow in antarctica ( actually somewhere in north america . ) \\nmake this fantastic film feel more real . \\nward russell\\'s cinematography is very good . \\nthe overall look is dark and ominous , appropriate to the intended tone of the film\\'s plot . \\nrussell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding . \\nwhen the movie is set in darkness , the picture quality is still rich and detailed . \\nfinally , and specifically , there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train . \\ni don\\'t know if the shot is faked in any way , but it looks dangerous , and it looks great . \\nthe movie\\'s soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film . ( skip \\nto the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie - there is a spoiler in the following sentences . ) during the opening prehistoric sequence , a howling wind dogs the soundtrack , never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound . \\nin one of the movie\\'s most effective sequences , metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees . \\nthe visuals of the scene are good , but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound . \\nthere was no question as to who the movie\\'s stars would be . \\neven so , duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and a good combination . \\nboth are easy on the eyes and together , they have some good timing , banter , and energy . \\nthere is a hint of chemistry between them , but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship . \\nthey are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street . \\nthere might be some romantic interest , but for now they\\'re more interested in their environs than they are in each other . \\nno single element really makes this movie outstanding - not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular . \\nbut enough things were done right that the x-files is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along . \\n',\n",
       " b'it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival\\'s palme d\\'or , a $100 million-plus box office gross , and an oscar nomination ? all for his sophomore outing , pulp fiction . \\nsince then , the talented film maker has been virtually invisible , surfacing briefly as a co-director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire-fest , from dusk till dawn . \\nin between , he has moonlighted as an \" actor \" with several decidedly unmemorable performances . \\nnow , with much fanfare and anticipation , tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort , jackie brown . \\nand , while this motion picture , adapted from elmore leonard\\'s novel , rum punch , offers solid entertainment , those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed . \\nfor the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie . \\nthe story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double-crosses and triple-crosses . \\nand the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue , unexpected gunfire , \\'70s pop tunes , and close-ups of womens\\' bare feet . \\nyet , for all of that , the production is something of a letdown . \\nthe sheer , in-your-face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent . \\nthe mostly-straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn\\'t match up favorably to the non-linear style of tarantino\\'s previous efforts ? an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives . \\nand there aren\\'t nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around . \\nthere\\'s a samuel l . jackson monologue about guns , a jackson/chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson/robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson/travolta material from pulp fiction , but that\\'s about it . \\njackie brown\\'s lone \" innovation \" is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives . \\nthis isn\\'t exactly an original technique ? it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa\\'s rashomon and most recently in edward zwick\\'s courage under fire . \\nhowever , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view , tarantino\\'s sole purpose for using it appears to be because it\\'s unconventional . \\nhad the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost . \\nas a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity . \\nfor the second picture in a row , tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a \\'70s icon . \\nthis time around , instead of john travolta , it\\'s blaxploitation queen pam grier ( foxy brown has become jackie brown ) . \\nin one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier\\'s career , tarantino uses a \\'70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits . \\nthere are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt-kicking ) . \\ngrier is jackie brown , a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states . \\nshe\\'s working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official . \\nno longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie , ordell arranges for a bail bondsman , max cherry ( robert forster , tv\\'s \" banyon \" ) to post the necessary $10 , 000 , then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal . \\njackie passes ordell\\'s test , however , and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 of ordell\\'s money into the united states without tipping off the feds . \\nsoon , just about everyone is after that money , including jackie , max , ray , ordell\\'s perpetually oversexed and drugged-out girlfriend , melanie ( bridget fonda ) , and his right-hand man , louis ( robert de niro ) . \\nunsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l . jackson , but ordell isn\\'t nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction . \\nin addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good , although hers is not an oscar- caliber performance ( although she might get a nomination ) . \\nrobert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough-guys-who-rarely- smile roles . \\nbridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino\\'s foot fetish . \\nrobert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy- looking , middle-aged actor . \\nthe film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two-and-a- half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) . \\ntarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself . \\nwhen it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) , jackie brown is a second-tier effort . \\nit\\'s an entertaining diversion , but not a masterpiece , and certainly not an oscar contender . \\n',\n",
       " b\"let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal . \\nso i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal . \\ni watched the matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times . \\nunder no circumstances , should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix . \\nthis theater , owned by the parent company of one of hollywood's biggest studios , hasn't even graduated into stereo sound yet . \\nthe mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age . \\nin other words , the sound sucked . \\nas someone used to digital sound in a movie theater , bad sound doesn't do anything to add to a film . \\ni'm not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together . \\nthere , i've had my rant , now on with the regularly scheduled review . \\nwhich sadly won't include commentary on the film's sound which i'm assuming was spectacular , but i'm just guessing . \\nmy guess on the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix . \\nit is nothing short of stunning visually . \\nsadly , the rest of the film , while pretty good , doesn't quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good . \\nthe matrix has at it's core a good concept , although it strays into the confusing side more often than i would have liked . \\nkeanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just a hoax . \\nit turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster . \\nnow machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator , plugged into a computer network . \\nthe computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a representation of the earth before it was destroyed . \\nthe population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose . \\nthat is except a small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons . \\nthey now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie . \\nreeve's character , neo , is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . \\nnewcomer carrie-anne moss and one of hollywood's most underrated actors , joe pantoliano , join fishburne in the band of freedom-fighters . \\nthe action sequences are nothing short of spectacular . \\nthis can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor's extensive pre-production training in martial arts . \\nthis lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film . \\nwhen you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world , it all adds up to an eyeful . \\nas i already said , the visuals far outpace the rest of the film . \\nacting in the matrix is not bad , but it certainly isn't real good either . \\nkeanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances . \\nalthough to his credit , it is one of his better performances . \\nlaurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in a sci-fi action film . \\nmore than a few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama . \\njoe pantoliano was a little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had . \\ncarrie-anne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role . \\nit's nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks . \\nyou have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film . \\nit was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences . \\ni also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue , which was terrible at times . \\nin more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird . \\nit almost seems as though the writers were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie . \\nso they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about . \\nthereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability . \\nmy other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending . \\nthe setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many a bad film before . \\nthe ending itself was just plain strange . \\nthe main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation which make this a real treat to watch . \\nwhile the rest of the film ( acting , dialogue and to a degree plot ) detract from the high production values , they don't detract enough to prevent me from recommending the matrix as a fun way to spend an evening . \\n\",\n",
       " b'wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day ? provided , of course , that you\\'re the victim of a frontal lobotomy . \\nthere is , in fact , no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at : movie-goers in their late teens and early twenties -- the most lucrative target group . \\nthis is film noir for the mtv generation : fast-paced , slick , flashy , gleefully mindless , and hollow to the core . \\nwild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998 . \\ni\\'ve seen more convincing drama ( with nearly as much bare flesh ) on that pinnacle of narrative quality , baywatch . \\nwild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking it\\'s a thriller with a real story . \\nwhat it is , however , is a series of increasingly- improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists . \\neverything in between those serpentine moments is filler -- a flash of a breast , a spatter of blood , and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie . \\nthe film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess -- just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen , and that will probably be it . \\nusing this approach , i was right three times and wrong only once . \\nthat\\'s not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about what\\'s around the next corner . \\nthe ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie : the hot , young cast and the old standby , sex . \\nboth have an abundance of screen time , although i\\'ll admit that the film\\'s erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected . \\nnothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu ? . \\nthe soft-core sex sequences are generic , and don\\'t generate much heat . \\nthe lesbian kisses can\\'t hold a candle to those in bound . \\ntheresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances ( neve campbell , possessing an iron-clad \" no nudity \" clause in her contract , keeps her clothes more or less on ) . \\nthe film\\'s greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower . \\nmaybe a few girls will skip seeing a fully-clothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick ( mrs . \\nkevin bacon ) is familiar with . \\nthe director of wild things is john mcnaughton , whose last effort was the finely-tuned psychological thriller , normal life . \\nthat movie featured copious sex , a pair of real characters , and a powerful script . \\nit\\'s difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker . \\nbut i suppose we all need to put food on the table . \\nmcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here , in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success ( his previous wide-release picture , mad dog and glory , was a box-office disappointment ) . \\nquick cuts and pretty sunrises can\\'t even begin to cover up this movie\\'s flaws . \\nthe main character ( and i use that term lightly , since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality ) is sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a guidance counselor at florida\\'s blue bay high school . \\na student , the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , has a crush on him . \\none afternoon , she comes to his house to wash his car , and , when she leaves , her clothing is torn . \\nafter confessing to her mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped , she goes to the police station , where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) . \\nthey are skeptical about here claims until another girl , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , comes forward with a similar tale . \\nmeanwhile , sam , convinced that he\\'s being set up , goes to a shyster lawyer ( bill murray ) for help . \\nthe acting in wild things isn\\'t very good , but none of the principals have much to work with . \\nthis is definitely not a character- based motion picture . \\nnot only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have a triple-digit i . q . , but it doesn\\'t bother to give any of the on-screen individuals even a hint of depth . \\nthe men and women populating the picture are there to look nice , but nothing more . \\nmatt dillon is given plenty of opportunities to flex his biceps . \\nneve campbell gets to model the slutty look . \\ndenise richards strikes a fetching pose in a see-through , one-piece bathing suit . \\nand nothing in the film gets a rise out of kevin bacon . \\nthe only one who\\'s even remotely interesting is bill murray , and he seems to think he\\'s in comedy , not a thriller ( maybe he\\'s got the right idea ) . \\ncolumbia pictures has specifically requested that critics not reveal the film\\'s ending , which prompts the question : which ending do they want kept secret ? \\nwild things has no less than three ( one occurs during the end credits , so stay seated ) , all of which are jaw-droppingly absurd -- a feat that joe eszterhas ( the writer of basic instinct and showgirls ) would be impressed by . \\nthanks to jeffrey kimball\\'s polished , kinetic cinematography , wild things always looks great , and george s . clinton\\'s score keeps it pulsing and throbbing . \\nbut , no matter how shiny the superficial sheen is , this is still trash , and , like all garbage , it stinks . \\n',\n",

the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally ) . \\ndamon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly-groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together . \\nhe never sounds like he\\'s reading from a script , nor that he\\'s trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him . \\nthe screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys\\' faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite . \\nimmediately we get the sense that poker isn\\'t for gamblers , but for near- geniuses with nerves of steel . \\nthe game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers . \\nthe gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man . \\nthe film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act . \\nit concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit . \\nwe learn only a little about mike , both past and present . \\npresently we know he has a girlfriend named jo ( gretchen mol ) who he constantly argues with over his gambling . \\nthey go through a few break-up/make-up cycles until mike\\'s childhood pal and fellow rounder \" worm \" ( norton ) is released from prison . \\nit\\'s not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob , but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does . \\ntechnically , the plot isn\\'t unlike many children\\'s sitcoms in which the \" good \" kid\\'s \" bad \" friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid . \\nwhat this film does is use a different medium to tell that story . \\nmike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives , but both share a passion for out-thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them . \\nwhere as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) , mike always takes the cards he\\'s dealt and works with them . \\nsometimes they pay off ( i . e . \\nhis ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money ) , but other times they don\\'t ( i . e . \\nthe fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping $30 , 000 on a single hand ) . \\nonce things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood . \\nmike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places , from socialites\\' mansions , to taking the tourists at atlantic city , to outwitting the gangsters that control it all . \\neverything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything\\'s a battle against the cards destiny deals . \\none scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge ( martin landou , in a perfectly cast and performed role ) that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time . \\nmatt\\'s good at gambling but he\\'s also got potential to be a great lawyer . \\nhe could go professional as either , but with one he could lose everything or win big , but with the other there\\'s stability but not much risk involved . \\ncan someone who\\'s gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave ? \\nif the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker-playing , then the ending is our test . \\neverything is told from mike\\'s perspective , but we\\'re finally able to recognize some things on our own . \\nthis makes the final , against-all- odds showdown seem like just that . \\nit works just like the game it revolves around -

       " b\"the grandfather of italian horror the late mario bava has credits in nearly 100 films and tv movies produced in italy between 1939 and his death in the early 80's . \\nmore practiced as a cinematographer than a director , bava nonetheless sat in the director's chair for beyond the door ii , the project which turned out to be his last full-length feature film . \\nalongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks like lucio fulci , beyond the door ii is simply a revelation . \\nin his day bava was considered by most to be no great filmmaker , yet here he fashioned one of the finest italian horror movies of the 1970's . \\n ( note that the film has no connection with the 1975 exorcist-rip off behind the door , but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia . ) \\nthis story focuses on dora , a women set upon by a malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco . \\nthe film opens with dora , her son and second husband bruno returning to a house by the sea that was the scene of her first husband's suicide and her subsequent trauma 7 years earlier . \\nthey hope to put the past behind them , but as small accidents start to befall dora - usually while bruno is away on business - she starts to suspect that marco ( played with uncanny ability by 8 year old david colin jr . ) is somehow involved in the strange goings on . \\nto reveal any more of the story would be unfair . \\nsuffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot , loads of atmosphere and solid acting , though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english . \\nbava coaches a surprisingly good performance from the usually wooden daria nicolodi , wife of famed italian horror director dario argento . \\nher character is invested with sufficient depth to allow the audience real empathy with dora's troubled soul . \\nthe music by italian ensemble libra is also effective , mixing odd-sounding 70's rock with classic gothic piano sequences . \\nand there is at least one moment - brilliantly engineered by bava - that is guaranteed to lift you ten feet out of your chair . \\nyet for italian horror , the bloodletting here is surprisingly minimal . \\nlamberto bava and francesco barbieri's script is more concerned with deeper , psychological terrors , with themes of guilt and suffering , with the notion that what we sow will shall - somewhere , somehow - eventually reap . \\nscholars of the genre take note : beyond the door ii is stylish , chilling , and essential . \\n\",\n",

) \\napril\\'s parents , feeling like there is no recourse , call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb ( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer ) their way . \\nthe bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the \" circuitry \" and they re-wire it and send it back to washington d . c . , destroying it . \\nmr . and ms . pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own . \\ni\\'m not sure if writer/director/co-star jeff b . harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs . \\neither way , he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie . \\nthe film opens with a preacher running a small african-american child out of town , and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan ( during a jaunty musical number ) , preceded by remarks about \" gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others , such as the jews \" . \\nif harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be , then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film , but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can\\'t help but feel like he had some serious intent . \\nas for the entire central theme of the movie , i\\'m afraid that it\\'s one that i just don\\'t get . \\ni tried to keep an open mind while watching it , but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes . \\nit was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society . \\nhow does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non-acceptance ? \\ni\\'m not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society , but don\\'t force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren\\'t going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me . \\nagain , maybe i\\'m missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make , but if so , i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully . \\nas far as musical comedies go , isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical , but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy . \\ndespite the disturbing visuals , \" mom and apple pie \" stuck with me for the rest of the day . \\nspeaking of disturbing visuals , \" wedding bells ain\\'t ringing \" could have been a decent song , but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying . \\n \" i\\'m a lesbian \" ( which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular ) is also pretty good , but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms . smith . \\nit\\'s mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based . \\nthe other performers are decent , save for the rosie o\\'donnell like performance given by danica sheridan . \\ni have no inherent problem with her character ; it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired . \\none particular musical number , \" lesbian rock \" , was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my film-going life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan . \\nthe film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll . \\nthe remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs ( \" lesbian rock \" included ) and the ridiculously presented anti-nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film . \\nonce the \" isle of lesbos reprise \" was reached , i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all . \\nwhy was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end ? \\nisle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www . indie-underground . com . \\nthe transfer is pretty clean ( and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent ) and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1 . 85 : 1 . \\nin many respects , isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential ( like a rocky horror for the new millennium ) . \\nthis film is by no means my cup of tea , but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it . \\nif you think it might be for you , then by all means seek it out . \\ni , on the other hand , will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator . . . \\nwait . aren\\'t gladiator films considered to be . . . \\noh , never mind . \\n',\n",
       " b'three things i learned from \" being john malkovich \" : when getting on the elevator for your first day of work on the 7 1/2th floor of a building , always bring your crowbar ; don\\'t stand in the way of your wife\\'s actualization as a man ; and , whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human being , wear old clothes , because , hey , it\\'s muddy in there . \\n \" being john malkovich \" is the most original film to come down the pike in a very long time . \\nwildly surrealistic , yet presented in a down-to-earth , funky style , this is the kind of movie that sticks in your head . \\nafter savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline , you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it . \\nfrom the ethics of relationships and politics of immortality to the very nature of identity itself , there\\'s a lot to think about here . \\njust don\\'t forget to have fun . \\nclearly , all parties involved in the making of the film certainly did , starting with writer charles kaufman . \\n \" i wrote \\'being john malkovich\\' without an outline , \" he explains in the press notes , \" blindly , with no sense of direction or purpose . \\nit\\'s important to me that i don\\'t have a map before i start . \\nthis allows me to surprise myself , stay engaged , discover things , and , hopefully , allow the unconscious to surface . \" \\nspike jonze ( mark wahlberg\\'s na ?

       " b'you know , i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man . \\nwhile watching instinct , i couldn\\'t help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the well-explored themes of those earlier movies . \\neven beside the tarzan comparison , instinct just isn\\'t a very good film . \\nit\\'s painfully idealistic , manipulative , and silly . \\ni didn\\'t hate it -- it\\'s simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins ; furthermore , most of the acting is quite good . \\nbut i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved . \\ni can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct , and it\\'s pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams . \\nthings start off in the predictable way , as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero , theo caulder ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , an ambitious , young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced , old psychiatrist ( donald sutherland ) . \\ncaulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life , the one he thinks will make him famous . \\nthe subject is ethan powell ( hopkins ) , an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years . \\npowell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa , and it\\'s now caulder\\'s job to find out of he\\'s mentally competent enough to stand trial . \\nthrough a series of short sessions , caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell . \\neven though it really is an old man version of tarzan , much of this central idea is rather interesting . \\nas i said , hopkins is captivating for every second he\\'s on screen ; he has a way of convincing us that he\\'s not acting , that he\\'s actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas . \\nthe character himself isn\\'t very interesting -- he\\'s just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas -- but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action . \\ngooding jr . does strong work opposite hopkins , playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual . \\nthe screenplay , written by gerald di pego and \" suggested by \" a novel by daniel quinn , gives us no background information on caulder , but that seems to be the point ( he has no time for friends because he\\'s obsessed with his work ) . \\nnonetheless , these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct . \\nunfortunately , filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting . \\nturtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instinct\\'s artistic failure , for they work together to make the dumbest , most cliche-ridden environment in which their characters are to live , and they do so by means of brainless subplots . \\nfirst , we have the prison warden subplot . \\nthe prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulder\\'s progress at any cost ; if this means taking caulder off the powell case , then that\\'s fine . \\nthere\\'s also the prison guard subplot . \\nthe prison guard is played by john ashton ; the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision , and he\\'s instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion . \\nthen there\\'s the daughter subplot , in which maura tierney ( playing the daughter ) must look very upset a lot of the time ; after all , she is the daughter of a deranged man . \\nif some of this stuff sounds familiar , that\\'s because they\\'re all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films . \\nthe evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here . \\nthe offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoo\\'s nest had . \\nashton\\'s evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy brown\\'s in the shawshank redemption . \\nhopkins\\' performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs . \\nand then there\\'s the whole tarzan thing , which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film . \\nperhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the half-hearted attempt at philosophical depth . \\nthe message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one : he thinks that humans are \" takers , \" that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas . \\ni can sympathize with that , but only when it\\'s in a compelling film . \\nthis is the kind of stupid movie -- just like patch adams -- in which a big group of characters ( psychotic inmates , in this case ) rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards . \\nwhat does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas ? \\nif all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor , we would have had a thirty-minute movie far superior to the two-hour one that i watched today . \\nif the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise , then we would really have had something interesting -- a movie that doesn\\'t rely on the strength of its actors . \\n',\n",

she softens and opens up to him . \\ntandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well , but unfortunately this feisty , cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace . \\nwe\\'ve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations , from on golden pond to cocoon . \\nnevertheless , tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own . \\nfreeman , as hoke , on the other hand , gives the more distinctive of the two performances . \\nthere is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color . \\nhoke is uneducated and illiterate , but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man , an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior . \\nboth freeman and tandy seem to be in their element , in full command of their natural charisma . \\nthey flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves . \\nthey bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie\\'s gentle humor . \\nat the same time , tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama . \\nin his first dramatic role , dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie , tandy\\'s loving and patient son . \\ndrama seems to agree with aykroyd ; taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor , especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ( ghostbusters ii , the great outdoors , my stepmother is an alien ) . \\nthe only other significant characters in the film are daisy\\'s housekeeper , idella , marvelously played by esther rolle ( \" good times \" ) , and boolie\\'s pretentious wife , played by patti lupone . \\nunder the direction of bruce beresford ( crimes of the heart , tender mercies ) , driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again . \\nbut fortunately , beresford never forgets he\\'s shooting a movie , and accordingly , he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches , such as gorgeous shots of flowers , trees , and tomatoes . \\nin adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen , the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety . \\nuhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say . \\nberesford wisely exercises restraint in the film\\'s dramatic moments . \\nthe movie tugs at your heart , but it never goes for the jugular . \\nthe only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees . \\n',\n",

whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money . \\nsince it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes , let\\'s use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers . \\ndecked out in flashy , trashy clothing and sporting big hair , vera baker ( whoopi goldberg ) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby . \\nshe finds that grown-up merrill ( lanai chapman ) is erudite , conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life . \\nthrown together , it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature . \\nowen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) is currently the most hated man in america . \\nan nfl referee , he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high-profile game . \\nafter escaping from a vengeful cab driver , owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention . \\nmr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) is a cheerful , odd little italian man on holiday in america . \\nhe also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times . \\npollini hitches a ride with zack ( wayne knight ) , a hyper-tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation . \\nrandy pear ( jon lovitz ) promised his wife beverly ( kathy najimy ) and two kids a fun-filled vacation in las vegas . \\nfearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race , he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview . \\nbeverly insists the family stay together , so they hop in the mini-van and tear off into the desert . \\nbrothers duane ( seth green ) and blaine ( vince vieluf ) cody are young , crooked and stupid . \\nblaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self-done tongue piercing , and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him . \\nthe boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal . \\nfinally , nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) is a no-nonsense lawyer-in-training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet ( amy smart ) for the journey . \\nat first glance , they seem blandly wholesome , but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn ( dean cain ) and spies him swimming with another woman . \\ndirector jerry zucker ( \" airplane , \" \" ghost \" ) leaps from racer to racer , periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr . grisham ( dave thomas ) , his personality-impaired right hand man , continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers . \\nas with any zucker production , a few jokes fall flat , but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps . \\nhigh points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally , with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay-off . \\nhad i been part of the filmmaking team , i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby\\'s clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron . \\nit would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm-inducing hint of child molestation . \\ni also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence . \\nmy god , do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing \" all star ?

       " b'the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made . \\ni know that is very sweeping statement , so i\\'ll qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of \" science fiction , \" stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot . \\n2001 : a space odyssey is probably a better film , but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science . \\nmost all other films we normally classify as science fiction , or sf , are really just fantasy , action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting . \\nthe andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a high-tech ( for 1970 ) van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town . \\nsomething bad happens to them . \\npictures from a reconnaissance plane show a shocking sight . \\napparently everyone in the town is dead . \\nthe authorities call a \" wildfire alert , \" summoning four scientists , all but one of them somewhat reluctant , to a super-secret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada . \\ntwo of scientists , stone and hall , fly directly to the town in space suits and find a town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks , their blood turned to powder in their veins . \\nsome went insane before they died and two of them , a baby and an old wino , are miraculously still alive . \\nthey take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab , where stone pressures the white house to call up a \" directive 712 , \" an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with a nuclear bomb . \\nwhat they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda , an organism that defies all the normal rules of earth-like life and mutates as it grows . \\ntheir only hope to cure it is to find out what a perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict . \\nwhat they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the a-bomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet . \\nthey barely call off the bombing in time . \\nbut then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out . \\nthis triggers the lab\\'s last-ditch defense mechanism , an atomic bomb . \\nto those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days , the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow . \\nmuch of the film is a lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts . \\nbut what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw . \\nthe performances are universally fine , with the actors keeping things low-key and restrained , just like scientists . \\nto me , the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting . \\nwe follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step , puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in a way we don\\'t expect . \\nthis film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it . \\nit was originally rated g when first released but it now carries the pg rating , mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which a body\\'s wrist is slashed , spilling its powdered blood . \\n',\n",

the other is run by chicago-connected italian mobster strozzi ( ned eisenberg ) . \\ncalling himself john smith , the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict , and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle's side . \\nbut smith's allegiance is as uncertain as his name , and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them . \\nviewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint , and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes-cum-bastardizations . \\nthere is the happily ineffectual lawman ( bruce dern ) , the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses' affections ( karina lombard ) , the barkeep who becomes our anti-hero's only friend ( william sanderson ) , suspicious lieutenants ( christopher walken and michael imperioli ) to question the bosses' trust in smith , a brutal beating , and a big fire . \\ndirector walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids , including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity , but at least he doesn't try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture . \\nwhat he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake , and that is to provide a running voice-over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard-boiled style of pulp detective fiction . \\nyes , that narration is full of cliches , but those are are not particularly troubling . \\nthe problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters . \\nthey were a mystery , to the other characters in the film and to the audience , their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted , and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status . \\nwith john smith's voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought , he becomes more mundane , just another tough guy trying to stay alive . \\nit feels like a hammett novel , all right , and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice , but it simply doesn't work . \\nthe narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence , and the man with no name takes _no one_ into his confidence . \\neven if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate , i can't imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction . \\nwillis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith , but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else . \\nchristopher walken plays doyle's brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft-spoken psychos , and there isn't another single character whom makes even the slightest impression . \\nwith no compelling antagonist for smith , there is no build-up towards the expected showdown , and when it does come , that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about . \\ncinematographer lloyd ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on hill's 1995 flop wild bill ) creates some nifty sunburned vistas , but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter-productive narration . \\nsometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original , they'll wonder what all the talk was about . \\nin the case of last man standing , it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about . \\n\",\n",

       " b'city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most : thought-provoking , moving , and completely unsentimental . \\ni find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant , which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality . \\ncity of angels is a wonderful film , enhanced by interesting and well-rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years . \\nit\\'s a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story , and avoids most of the cliches we\\'re so used to seeing in films like this . \\ncity of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders\\' 1988 film wings of desire . \\ni have yet to see wings of desire , so i am , unfortunately , unable to make a comparison of the two . \\ni have heard , however , that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways , which makes me glad that this film isn\\'t a rip-off of its source material . \\nnicolas cage stars as seth , an angel who , like all of his angel counterparts , is present to lead the dying to heaven ( or somewhere just like it ) . \\none day , he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr . maggie rice ( meg ryan ) , and his attention is called to her . \\nthe angels can make themselves seen to humans , but they can\\'t experience any of the senses ( most importantly , touch ) . \\nhe shows himself to maggie , and she falls for him , unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status . \\nseth wants to become human so he can feel her . \\nthat\\'s when he meets nathaniel messinger ( dennis franz ) , \" former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race . \" \\n ( as a side note , i found messinger to be the most fascinating character , for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death . ) \\nmessinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human . \\nseth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel ( i know , it sounds ridiculous , but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well-done ) ; after much deliberation , she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel . \\nthis , of course , is when seth decides to take the plunge ( literally ) from a building ; when he wakes up from the fall , he is human , and happy to feel what it\\'s like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead . \\nsince i love this film so much , i\\'ll make a minor note that it certainly isn\\'t perfect . \\nalthough it is original and mesmerizing , it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre . \\nthe plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic ( though the details are what make the story excellent , and steel has done a great job with them ) . \\nthe ending , too , could have been more powerful and less predictable . \\nthese elements are minor , though , and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels . \\nthe acting is superb from everyone involved . \\nthis is perhaps my second-favorite performance from cage ( my favorite being the rock ) . \\nhe\\'s quiet and pensive , and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly-toned words . \\nhe\\'s perfect for a role like this , and at the same time he reassures us he\\'s not bound by playing the psycho ( though he is good at it , as he shows in face/off ) . \\nmeg ryan is a powerful , enticing , and appealingly-chirpy actress , and her work here is some of her best . \\ndennis franz , however , steals all of his scenes as the energetic former-angel . \\nwhat i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation . \\ndirector brad silberling is a talented man , and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters , rather than forced sentimentality . \\nhis direction is steady , and he shows this in just about every scene : near the beginning , maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead . \\nthere is no music or elaborate camera work ; we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information . \\nthis is the way stories should be told , and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real . \\nthe film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do . \\ncinematographer john seale ( the english patient ) provides some of the most stunning images i\\'ve seen on the big screen : hundreds of black-clad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours ( just as an example ) . \\nthe music , by gabriel yared ( also of the english patient ) , is perfect for this film : it\\'s quiet and moody music ( but not sentimental ! ) , and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely . \\nthe visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far . \\nall of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre . \\nit\\'s a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across--the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously . \\n',\n",

       " b'john boorman\\'s \" zardoz \" is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own . \\nnot since the rampant bumblings of one edward d . wood jr . has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time . \\nof course , wood\\'s career can be explained by two things : he had no money and he had no talent . \\nboorman , on the other hand , cannot court such excuses to explain \" zardoz \" ( or his follow-up film , the equally awful \" exorcist ii : the heretic \" ) . \\nboorman obviously had a sizable budget , a matinee idol movie star ( sean connery ) in the lead role , and although you wouldn\\'t know it from this film , boorman does indeed have talent . \\nthis is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece \" deliverance \" ( 1972 ) , as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama \" hope and glory \" ( 1987 ) , the slightly over-conceived arthurian epic \" excalibur \" ( 1981 ) and the father-son jungle adventure \" the emerald forest \" ( 1985 ) . \\nhis films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination , but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste . \\nif boorman is anything , he\\'s ambitious , and when he succeeds , it\\'s in grand fashion . \\nunfortunately , the bigger they are , the harder they fall , and when boorman falls , the resounding impact can be heard for miles around . \\n \" zardoz \" is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies , an obsession of boorman\\'s . \\nhis screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even \" the wizard of oz , \" a book which figures into the movie\\'s plot . \\nbut , despite all this reaching , the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling . \\nthe events take place in the distant year 2293 , but there is little of the typical futuristic movie-ness to be found . \\nin fact , things seems to have moved backwards , with people riding horses , shooting old-style guns , and living in large victorian mansions . \\nit\\'s more middle ages than space age . \\nthe world of \" zardoz \" is divided into two distinct hemispheres : the outlands , where all the poor , pathetic people live , and the vortex , where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life . \\nthese immortals never grow old , they never engage in sexual activity , they possess psychological powers , and they live in a sort of quasi-utopian marxist society where everyone is equal , and everyone contributes equally to the society . \\nhowever , if one breaks the rules , that person is punished by being aged so many years . \\nif someone breaks the rules enough , he or she is aged to the point of senility , and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals . \\none of the immortals , arthur frayn ( niall buggy ) , a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face , is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed . \\nlike \" the wizard of oz , \" he adopts a god-like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head . \\n ( this flying head is one of the movie\\'s opening images , and it\\'s a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come . ) \\ncalling himself zardoz , frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators , whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can\\'t procreate and take up more resources . \\nfrom inside his giant , stone head , zardoz bellows seriously laugh-inducting statements like , \" the gun is good . \\nthe penis is evil . \" \\nthat line alone is worth the movie\\'s cult following . \\none day , an exterminator named zed ( sean connery ) , sneaks into zardoz\\'s flying stone , pushes frayn out , and goes back to the vortex . \\nonce there , the immortals label him a \" brutal \" and study him like a lab rat , taking great , perverse care in exploring his sexuality , which is a mystery to them . \\nthey seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection , and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily-clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up . \\ni say \" hilarious \" because that is exactly what \" zardoz \" is . \\nit is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made this film with the straightest of faces , although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward , he didn\\'t get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming . \\njust looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper , a mane of hair braided halfway down his back , a wyatt earp-style handlebar mustache , and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker . \\nboorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of \" deliverance , \" which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green-light this effort . \\nhe attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera , including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth ( \" 2001 \" ) , whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in \" zardoz \" besides the inadvertent humor . \\nsean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 , and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace . \\nhe got exactly that in \" zardoz , \" and it\\'s a wonder it didn\\'t end his career . \\ni\\'m sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements . \\nis it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life ? \\nis it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing ? \\nor is it a social statement , something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates ? \\nkarl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary . \\ncome to think of it , maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip . \\npeople high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy . \\n',\n",

unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling . \\nthis portion of the film is where the \" sense of closure \" could have been successfully accomplished . \\nunfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters . \\nwhile ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film . \\nthe synergism of the tension of ravel\\'s music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen . \\nthe directing in this movie is wonderful . \\nthe actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth . \\nemmanuelle beart\\'s personality is beautiful . \\nand needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful . \\nbesides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral . \\ni almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of . \\nthe one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ? \\ni have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing . \\nin summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship . \\nin the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people . \\nin itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie . \\nwhere it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people . \\ni do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture . \\nhowever , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film . \\ni would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it . \\n',\n",

       " b\"jonathan demme's _beloved_ , based on the book toni morrison , is a study in skillful literary adaptation . \\non the one hand , the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel , evoking morrison's pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice . \\non the other hand , beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book , favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story's main events . \\nthis choice is a smartly made one , for it creates an open space in which the story's wide range of emotions can gestate and grow . \\nindeed , the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled . \\n_beloved_ takes place in the second half of the 19th century , during the so-called reconstruction era after the civil war . \\nfor newly-freed slaves , it is a time of confusion and turmoil . \\noprah winfrey is sethe , a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse , where she hoped the terror would end . \\nwhat she did not know was that it would follow her there , and remain with her long after the physical threat had vanished . \\n_beloved_ ultimately tells the story of sethe's search for forgiveness , one long-hampered by an unforgettable sin . \\nthe film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethe's escape , as a violent , unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse . \\ninvisible hands terrorize her family , flinging objects across rooms , shaking tables , rattling floorboards . \\nsethe's sons run away , perhaps for good , leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves . \\ndemme's matter-of-fact handling of this supernatural element is just one of _beloved_'s intriguing aspects . \\nall of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real . \\nwhen paul d ( danny glover ) -- a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe -- arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghost's hellish visions , he doesn't run in terror . \\ninstead , he asks who the ghost is . \\nas in morrison's novel , demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself , but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created . \\nsethe is the one being haunted , but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears . \\nin fact , the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay . \\nthe story takes an bizarre turn with the appearance of beloved ( thandie newton ) , a young black-clad woman who appears on sethe's front lawn , leaned christ-like against a tree stump . \\nsethe and denver immediately take to the rasping woman and try to nurse her to health . \\nthey know not who she is , but that doesn't matter . \\nonly paul d is suspicious of the stranger . \\nlittle does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes , and force sethe to release a guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen years . \\nwinfrey is arguably beloved's greatest asset . \\nshe inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show . \\nlisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe , whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later . \\ndanny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d , as is kimberly elise as denver , sethe's wanderlusting daughter . \\nas sethe's sage-like mother-in-law old baby suggs , beah richards authoritatively commands every scene in which she appears . \\nthe film's least palatable choice of casting is unfortunately that of the role of beloved herself . \\nthandie newton plays the glassy-eyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at first , but which becomes off-putting and unintentionally laughable by the end . \\ndeparting from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as _the silence of the lambs_ and _melvin & howard_ , director demme has used a bit of dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrison's novel . \\ntotemic camera shots and color-saturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demme's films , but the few he uses here work to the film's benefit . \\n_beloved_'s most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs' gatherings in a forest clearing , where the bright yellow-greens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs' words do . \\nfor the most part , though , demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality . \\nthis , combined with morrison's equally frugal method of storytelling , may make _beloved_ somewhat of a challenge to watch , even to those familiar with the book . \\nthough the film compliments the book extraordinarily well , it falls short in allowing the sort of accessibility one usually expects from a film . \\nnothing is spoon-fed to the viewer . \\nmorrison's novel is just as enigmatic , but unlike a movie , a book can be put down to allow the various undercurrents and themes to churn and absorb . \\nthe movie begins like _poltergeist_ , and ends like _the color purple_ , with shades of _the scarlet letter_ and _little women_ somewhere in the middle . \\ntaken as a whole , beloved is a disquieting , one-of-a-kind experience , one to be viewed with guards down and spirits in abeyance . \\n\",\n",

       " b\"it's wednesday , march 27 , and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte , south carolina . \\nthe crime : a young prostitute , elizabeth ( renee zellweger ) , has been brutally slain . \\none half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station . \\nthe other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority , miles away . \\nthe police duo of braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are strapped for leads . \\nat the moment , they have only one possible suspect : wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy , unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act . \\nthat's the premise for deceiver , a new thriller from the pate brothers , jonas and josh , who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave . \\ndeceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not- so-bright cops ( captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland's iq is 151 ; by contrast , kennesaw's is 122 and braxton's is 102 ) . \\nthe setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered . \\nover three days , as wayland returns to answer more questions , the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until , inevitably , it boils over . \\nother plot elements are thrown in for good measure . \\nwayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can , in stressful situations , render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent . \\nbraxton , a compulsive gambler , is deep in debt to a local syndicate . \\nand kennesaw is haunted by a dark , abusive side that delights in terrorizing women , especially his wife ( rosanna arquette ) , whom he suspects of being unfaithful . \\nthe foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth's death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand : the suspect or his questioners . \\ndeceiver , which mostly transpires in a dimly-lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue , has the feel of a david mamet play : edgy , claustrophobic , and tense . \\nthe atmosphere is explosive , and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting . \\ndeceiver has the power to grab an audience . \\nunfortunately , in the end , it succumbs to the need to throw in one last , unexpected twist , and this is its undoing . \\nfor , while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers , it also stretches our credulity too much , and raises more questions than it answers . \\nit's only an effective wrap-up if you don't think too carefully about its full implications . \\nof course , the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic . \\npolice procedure is totally ignored and it's almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner . \\nbut the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction , not plot details . \\ndeceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station , and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute . \\nthe pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth's final days and hours . \\nthe most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice-over by visually showing what really happened . \\nmoments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks . \\nthe movie , obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir , drips atmosphere . \\nthere are some fascinating stylistic touches ; for example , although the setting is contemporary , all of the telephones are old-fashioned , rotary models . \\ncinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver's look . \\nsome of the things he tries ( mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow ) work exceptionally well , while others ( like any of several lazy susan shots ) seem more like unnecessary visual tricks . \\nas wayland , tim roth gives the film's top performance , despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting . \\nroth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he's supposed to be . \\nthe other two leads , chris penn and michael rooker , aren't as effective . \\nboth play their characters like familiar types . \\npenn's performance is uninspired ; rooker's lacks subtlety . \\nsome of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors . \\nrenee zellweger , in a role that's miles away from her star-making turn in jerry maguire , brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature . \\nrosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw's wife , and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who's entrusted with evaluating wayland's condition . \\none of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience . \\nplot points aren't hammered home , and , although the ending has its weaknesses , everything isn't spelled out in bold letters . \\nthe pates give audience members credit for having brains , which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers . \\noccasionally gripping and never uninteresting , deceiver is a fine noir effort . \\n\",\n",

\\nthe editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times . \\nthe real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego . \\nworking from a best- selling novel by nicholas sparks ( which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county ) , di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times . \\nits strict adherence to clich ? s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer ( 1998 ) . \\nthere simply isn't an original scene in this film . \\nthe dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking . \\nthis is director mandoki's first film since when a man loves a woman ( 1994 ) , the solid meg ryan/andy garcia romance . \\nhe's simply going through the motions with this . \\nmessage in a bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come ( 1998 ) as one of the most misguided romances of the decade . \\n\",\n",

       " b'for a film touted as exploring relationships and black sexuality , trois is surprisingly tame . \\ndespite it\\'s lurid subject matter and it\\'s passing nod to fatal attraction , it moves along with flat , uninspired dialogue as it sets up a surprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film . \\nfreshly moved to atlanta , jermaine ( dourdan ) and his wife , jasmine ( moore ) , have the trappings of a perfect life . \\nthey have a beautiful house in suburbia . \\njermaine is a lawyer on the fast track at his firm . \\njasmine is his supportive wife , who is finishing up her college degree . \\nin an opening montage via a home video of the pair , we see the unremarkable story of their marriage and early marital triumphs . \\nthis is a couple that has it all . \\ninto this eden slithers the lure of lust . \\ndespite his outward appearance , jermaine reveals himself as selfish and covetous of his wife more as a possession than a person . \\na glimmer of his true nature peeks out during an early sex scene with his wife as he goes about his business , oblivious to jasmine\\'s concerns . \\nwe also find that he has been relentlessly asking jasmine to participate in a menage- a-trois , much to jasmine\\'s dismay . \\nas jermaine puts it , \" don\\'t you want to be sexually free ? \" \\njermaine shares his desire with co-worker terrence ( smith ) , who obligingly sets jermaine up with a woman who might be interested in just such an encounter . \\nthe woman , jade ( palmer ) is a direct counterpoint to jasmine . \\njade , at one point was a college student , too . \\nunlike jasmine , she found herself pregnant , dropped out of school and now struggles to make ends meet . \\nto further reinforce their differences , it\\'s revealed that jade is involved in a custody battle over her son . \\ninevitably , through liquor and a touch of duplicity on jermaine\\'s part , the forbidden act is consummated . \\nthe aftermath of the encounter sidesteps into fatal attraction territory as acts of violence are perpetrated upon jermaine\\'s property with the hint that the violence may escalate . \\nby this point , trois shows itself to be a soap opera without the requisite melodrama : a fatal attraction without the social significance . \\nthe exploration of relationships is strictly superficial and stereotypical . \\njermaine comes off as insincere , sexually driven and selfish . \\njasmine is bland and subservient . \\njade comes off a bit sympathetically , but that is negated by her moral bankruptcy . \\nyet another tale of a sexually aggressive \" dog \" of a man who imposes his will upon his accommodating , innocent mate . \\nthe last 10 minutes will undoubtly throw you a curve , but by this point , will you even care ? \\nif the rest of the movie was as dynamic as the ending , perhaps there could have been some freshness to it . \\nas it stands , trois is pretty standard fare . \\n',\n",
       " b'i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of \" good will hunting \" , based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film , in which the main character will hunting ( matt damon ) , an mit janitor in his early twenties , is discovered to be an einstein-level closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight . \\nthe only problem is that will is a tough street kid who\\'s had his share of run-ins with the law , and before long he\\'s being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight . \\nprofessor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) , who had brought up the math problems in his lectures , tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police : will is to be released , provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions . \\nthis sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff , but \" good will hunting \" rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama . \\na conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will\\'s therapist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) - lambeau wants to get will to use his brain , while sean wants him to listen to his heart , both of which he has been largely neglecting . \\nwill finds that the former is much easier than the latter , so much so , in fact , that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau\\'s attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle . \\nhe also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar ( minnie driver ) , an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her . \\nwhat makes \" good will hunting \" work so well , aside from the strong performances ( especially from damon and williams ) , is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will\\'s life . \\nthe script\\'s sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau , but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong . \\nlambeau , while he may seem a little cold at times , is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we\\'re not sure if we like what he has to say . \\nand sean , for all his warm-heartedness , has , as lambeau and later will point out , not lived up to his full intellectual potential either ; the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will . \\nwill\\'s reaction to this situation , and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean , is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters\\' opinions , rather than setting up an obvious \" right \" and \" wrong \" side and beating them over the head with it . \\nfor a film with such an extraordinary character , \" good will hunting \" presents itself as remarkably ordinary ; it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman , a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another . \\nthis film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama , by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far-fetched situation . \\n \" good will hunting \" also has its share of fun humor , such as when will , in an early therapy session , pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture . \\nand in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear , will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa . \\nwill\\'s relationship with his friends , most notably chucky ( ben affleck ) , is usually rather amusing , if somewhat crude ( the film has 100+ uses of the \\'f\\' word , which was most likely the reason for its r-rating ) , and lends itself well to the development of will\\'s character . \\nadd all this to the fact that \" good will hunting \" even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental , and you might be wondering why i haven\\'t given this film four stars . \\nwell , for one thing , no matter how well damon and affleck , who wrote the screenplay , and director gus van sant pull it off , the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original . \\nthere are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic , including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions . \\nstill , \" good will hunting \" takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would , and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years , and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of \\'97 films . \\n',\n",
       " b'the thirteenth floor , the third in what i would call \" the reality check movie series \" , is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year , the matrix and existenz . \\nall three made you think , made you wonder what is real , what isn\\'t , and if our world is just a huge game . \\nthe thirteenth floor doesn\\'t reach the level of originality , creativity , and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz , but it certainly gives a great shot at it . \\nin the matrix , we were told that the humans are simply a virus . \\nin existenz , we learned that our life could be just a game . \\nin the thirteenth floor , we learn that we are just electronic devices , living under another world of electronic devices . \\nthere is just one world on top of another , and everything in them are fake and electronically generated . \\nthe thirteenth floor took a huge , risky turn that i didn\\'t expect it to take , and i\\'m not very sure it was such a great turn to make . \\nrather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film , the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds . \\nafter the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller , played by armin mueller-stahl , douglas hall , played by craig bierko , a man that worked under fuller for many years , must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using , to the year 1937 , which consists of computer generated characters only . \\nthe simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days . \\nall of the people involved are just characters , or are they ? \\ndouglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours , and killed fuller . \\nalong the way , douglas interacts with many different potential suspects , and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller , jane fuller , played wonderfully by a talented young actress , gretchen mol . \\nthe thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going , and doesn\\'t use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer\\'s interests . \\ni was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz , and i wouldn\\'t enjoy it , but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film . \\nunfortunately , many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content , letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened . \\nthe scenes that aren\\'t original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere , leaving you wondering , \" what is the point of this ? \" \\nsometimes it was hard to believe that this story , with terrible dialogue , some bad acting , especially from craig bierko , and scenes that go absolutely nowhere , are actually true . \\ni know this isn\\'t a true story or anything , but a film should be able to make you think that it is . \\non the plus side of acting , we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor , armin mueller-stahl . \\nin the thirteenth floor , he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances . \\nanother plus is gretchen mol\\'s realistic performance , creating her character with depth , not just staying in the one-dimensional phase . \\ndon\\'t expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor , just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile , and shuts you down like any other movie would . \\nthrills , chills , and spills aren\\'t what you will get in this film , but you will just get another trip to send your mind on , scrambling it until you\\'ve had enough . \\nthe bottom line- let\\'s hope this is the last of the \" reality check \" based movies for awhile . \\n',\n",

       " b\"keep cool , a chinese film directed by semi-accomplished filmmaker yimou zhang , was one of the kickoff films for this year's hawaii international film festival . \\non the day it premiered , lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block , some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater . \\nthey need not have wasted their time . \\nthe movie is billed as a comedy , but is surprisingly bereft of humor . \\nthere are noticeable attempts at laughs , but very few tries actually click . \\ni wondered if there were jokes that i wasn't getting because i'm not from china , but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn't be attributed to the cultural barrier either . \\nkeep cool just isn't very funny . \\nthe prelude to the film was a visit by keep cool's producer who , with the help of an interpreter , regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time , an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii . \\nalthough the print made it , the assistant's luggage was lost . \\ntoo bad that story wasn't in the movie , because it got a big laugh . \\nqu ying , the film's female lead , was also on hand to give a few comments . \\nhowever , whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed , ms . ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one , fast-paced , incredibly long tirade . \\nit was dizzying ; good foreshadowing for the film . \\nyou see , keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes . \\nat least that's the way it seems , since the camera is constantly moving . \\ncinema verite is one thing , but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another . \\nalthough some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing , i found it thoroughly distracting , and after a while , quite annoying . \\nheadache , as i said . \\nthe film is about a young bookseller ( wen jiang ) who is after a young woman ( qu ying ) . \\nthey used to be romantically involved , but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship . \\nthe first half of the film is about the young man's plan to win her back . \\nof course the thing is , she doesn't want to be won back , and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit . \\nin the fight , the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker , but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost . \\nwe later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced . \\nthere is a funny scene ( the only one in the film ) where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner ( baotian li ) in order to recoup his losses . \\nthere is no sense to be made out of the young woman's behavior ; cold one minute , caring the next , so we feel no sympathy for her character . \\nthe bookseller would be better off without her . \\nalthough the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well , who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner's hand as revenge for the beating he took , it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man . \\nwhile the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge , the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation . \\nhis quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with , but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time . \\na friendship develops between the two men , but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate . \\nalthough only an hour and a half in length , keep cool contains extraneous material . \\nthe whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out , since we don't see her from the midpoint on . \\na case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner , and would have saved us from the bookseller's boring pursuit during the first half . \\nbut of course , this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour . \\nthere are a few things that keep cool does right . \\nas mentioned before , the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good . \\nalthough it grows tiresome , the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic , and represents the differences in thinking between generations . \\nin one scene , for example , the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across , but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted , and that it means something entirely different . \\nalso effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene , such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner . \\nthe nightclub owner is counting out money , slapping each bundle of currency on the table . \\nwith every shot of his hand , we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge . \\nunfortunately , these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the film's shortcomings , and weren't enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater . \\n\",\n",
       " b'i read the new yorker magazine and i enjoy some of their really in-depth articles about some incident . \\nthey will take some incident like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail . \\nit becomes a real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested , and what kind of pressure the investigators are under , and just about any other aspect you can think of . \\nfrequently i get the feeling that the article sounded exciting , but i am being told in more detail than i really wanted to know . \\noften i get to the middle of a story and say , ok , it sounded good but i now have invested more time than i am willing to spend on this subject . \\nfilm is a different medium . \\nit is a visual medium . \\nthat slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize . \\ni frequently am surprised to find out how short a film script is and how much of the pages are empty space . \\nthe magazine article and the film script are two very different media . \\nthe insider is a film adaptation of the vanity fair article \" the man who knew too much \" by marie brenner . \\nit is too much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a film . \\nit really verges on being tedious at least at times . \\nfor years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused a host of unhealthy side-effects . \\nbut they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it . \\nthe business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco . \\nthe tide turned when a former vice-president of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking . \\nthe resulting pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at cbs . \\nwho were the major people involved , what were their motives , how was the story almost killed , how did it get aired anyway ? \\nthat is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider . \\nthis all could have been enthralling , but it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well . \\nand in the end , he failed . \\nto make a long story short , the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short . \\nthe film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist . \\nwe get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand . \\nthey go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace ( played by christopher plummer ) . \\nthere the news team under producer lowell bergman ( al pacino ) are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it . \\nthis seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story , but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists , we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world . \\nterrorists can grab the headlines , but the tobacco companies have the real position of power . \\nincongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand ( russell crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home . \\nwe discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly . \\nhe had been a very profitably rewarded vice-president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco ; now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family . \\nrather than support him his wife liane ( diane venora ) demands of him what are they supposed to do for income . \\nmeanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand . \\nthey offer wigand $12 , 000 just to interpret the data . \\nwigand\\'s severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings , but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms . \\nhe is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman . \\nin spite of the secrecy , wigand\\'s former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role . \\nand so the game begins . \\nwigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer . \\nmeanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family . \\nthe film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants . \\nwigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out . \\nhe and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost a legal fight . \\nal pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider . \\nthe story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous detail . \\nthe film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience . \\nthe musical score by pieter bourke , lisa gerrard , and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory . \\nit puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling . \\nalso disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace . \\nplummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too well-known for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly . \\nthis film might have been a really engaging experience under another director\\'s control . \\nmichael mann was the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lacks intensity because of his style . \\ni rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n',\n",
       " b'everyone knows someone like giles de\\'ath : stuffy , arrogant , set in his ways , and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with \" progress . \" \\ngiles is a writer , but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis . \\nhis house looks like an immaculate museum ? with no television , microwave , word processor , or other technological gadgets , only the electric lights betray that he\\'s living in the twentieth century , not the nineteenth . \\nthis is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype , but john hurt , in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career , turns \" erstwhile fogy \" giles into a three-dimensional human being . \\ndespite his tunnel vision , it\\'s impossible not to like the man , especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune : love . \\nand , as giles discovers during the course of this amusing , warm-hearted motion picture , it\\'s possible to find the object of one\\'s affection in the most unusual places . \\ngiles , who is a widower and a recluse , does not frequent the cinema , but when he learns that an e . m . forster film is playing at the local theater , he screws up his courage and decides to go . \\nwhat he doesn\\'t realize is that the movie house is showing two films : the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii . \\na nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress . \\njust as giles is about to leave , however , he notices ronnie bostock ( jason priestley ) , and , suddenly , it\\'s love at first sight . \\ngiles is enraptured , and the moment hotpants college ii is over , he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia , including teen magazines and video tapes . \\n ( in order to watch those tapes , giles must buy a vcr , but he initially doesn\\'t realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr . ) \\neventually , not satisfied with being the world\\'s foremost authority on bostock , giles boards a plane and travels to long island , where his idol\\'s home is located . \\nbostock is away when giles arrives , but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie\\'s supermodel girlfriend , audrey ( fiona loewi ) . \\neventually , the actor arrives home and , impressed with giles\\' demeanor and intelligence , he begins to rely on the older man\\'s advice . \\nbut , while giles\\' affection runs deep , ronnie\\'s feelings are less constant . \\nlove and death on long island is a comedy , and a very funny one at that . \\nin fact , for its first half , the film is nearly-perfect . \\nit suffers a fall-off once giles reaches new york , and the ending , with its none-too-subtle homosexual overtones , is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it . \\nin his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom , writer/director richard kwietniowski , adapting from the novel by gilbert adair , is 100% on- target . \\nin the process , he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles , but says a few things about the transforming power of love , even if it is unrequited . \\nfrom start to finish , this is clearly hurt\\'s movie ? he\\'s in almost every frame . \\nit\\'s a role that the veteran actor must have relished , because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure , and does so by means of dialogue delivery , body language , and ever-changing facial expressions . \\njason priestley , cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image , is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie . \\nhe is charismatic , and it\\'s not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie . \\nmeanwhile , solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always-reliable maury chaykin . \\nlove and death on long island is many things wrapped into one : a social commentary ( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment ) , a buddy picture/love story ( ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days ) , and a \" fish out of water \" tale ( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world ) . \\nyet , despite the many laughs love and death offers , it never takes cheap shots . \\nit has a vibrant , beating heart ? and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile . \\n',\n",
       " b'i\\'m not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing \" disturbing behavior \" with \" scream . \" \\nmaybe it\\'s because they\\'re both horror films ( kinda ) , both have hot young stars , both have an annoying alternative soundtrack , and both are aimed at the teenage crowd , which i guess includes me . \\nbut this is not the next in line with the \" scream \" flicks as well as the \" i know what you did last summer \" soon to be flicks . \\nit owes less to \" halloween \" and more to kafka and orwell , which , in my book , makes for a more interesting feature . \\nand it should have been . \\nthis is basically a rehash of \" the stepford wives , \" the great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross and dealing , as i\\'ve been told , with a bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives . \\nor something like that . \\n \" behavior , \" starring katie holmes of \" dawson\\'s creek , \" deals with a bunch of teenagers , deep in angst , who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers . \\nsuck-ups . \\npreppies . \\nit actually , at least to me , sounds like it would work , and with scott rosenberg , that witty penmen who has written stuff like \" beautiful girls \" and \" things to do in denver when you\\'re dead \" ( as well as \" con air \" ) , it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights and satiric wit . \\nalas , it\\'s not , and it plumets into that little group of movies known as \" the movies with potential that blow it . \" \\ni remember a film called \" white man\\'s burden \" which dealt with a reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing with it\\'s potentially brilliant premise . \\nhere\\'s another one . \\nit could be a brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves . \\nit\\'s a stage , and this film does in fact realize that . \\nit gets its message across and it does it effortlessly . \\nnow it just needs to work as a film . \\nwhich it doesn\\'t . \\nit\\'s too sloppy and too contrived . \\nit paints a bleak portrait of high school life . . . then \\nlets it lie . \\nit brings us a bunch of scary monsters who are all a bunch of disgustingly icky kiss-ups who do food drives and hang out at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes . . . then \\ngives it a cheap twist : when they get horny , they become homicidal . \\nisn\\'t it scary enough that they\\'re like this , and can\\'t the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them - not that you could be next to die ? \\nthe film introduces us two three different characters who , in the beginning , are considered outsiders because they\\'re not ( yet ) part of this clique : the new kid , steve ( james marsden - dull dull dull dull ) , who\\'s having trouble at home because he hasn\\'t gotten over his brother\\'s ( ethan embry , in quick flashes so you don\\'t recognize him - i did ) suicide ; the renegade girl , rachel ( katie holmes , from \" dawson\\'s creek \" ) , who\\'s chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring ; and by far the most interesting kid , gavin ( nick stahl , the kid from \" the man without a face \" ) , who\\'s the most interesting because he\\'s the only character who\\'s given some dimension . \\nin the film\\'s best scene , he introduces steve to every single clique , nailing each one\\'s fetishes and hang-ups , and it\\'s the best scene in the movie because it\\'s witty , satirical , and interesting - something the rest of this film isn\\'t . \\ngavin suspects there\\'s something awry with the preppie kids , known as the blue ribbons , and in the tradition of all conspirators , and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve , he\\'s only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff . \\nhere , we have another case of \" the idiot plot , \" where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him , but he may have saved this film from being the dreary , dull film that it is without gavin , who gives it life and humor . \\nthe only other half-interesting character is the school janitor , played by william sadler as a retarded , scary guy who may not be what he seems to be . . . but \\nreally , we don\\'t care anyway . \\ni probably shouldn\\'t mention that this was directed by david nutter , who\\'s works for \" the x-files , \" because that would probably tarnish his reputation . \\nlike the show , he\\'s good at setting up weird conspiracies , and creating a general creepy feel . \\nmost of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect , and some of it works . \\nbut what this film is not so good at is coming out with a good payoff . \\nhe keeps too much inside , so much that when the characters journey to a mental institution in the third act , you wonder why they just don\\'t get the hell out of there . \\ni think what happens to gavin is proof enough that there\\'s something rotten in the state of teen angstdom . \\nwhat this film needs to be is a lot longer , a lot more colorful , and a lot creepier . \\nif the best villain they can come up with is a guidance counselor ( played by bruce greenwood , an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent ) who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed , then they need to come up with a tougher , smarter villain . \\nif he\\'s so villainous , then why could two dense teenagers who couldn\\'t figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in a couple minutes ? \\nthe film , which runs about 80 or so minutes , just needs to work on these things , and become a lot less sloppy . \\nat such a short running time and with such lame , boring characters as these , it\\'s pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in one\\'s mouth , especially mine . \\n',\n",

       " b\"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\nmilos forman's first film since the ill-fated valmont , columbia's the people vs . \\nlarry flynt , is a vastly entertaining ( if not particularly enlightening ) biopic of hustler publisher and self-made millionaire larry flynt , who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s . \\nthe film unweaves its tale in a chronological order : we open with young and dirt-poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy , peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky . \\ncut to forward in time , where the two flynt brothers , now young men , are running the struggling hustler go-go clubs in cincinnati . \\nthe strip clubs are in a dire financial state , and in a last-ditch effort to salvage the operations , flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter . \\nthis evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine , creating larry flynt a vast financial empire , and the rest is history . \\nwhat sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material , and who railed and preached against him - flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt - and his driven , single-minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression , regardless of personal cost . \\nthe people vs . \\nlarry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynt's true love , althea leasure , whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries , and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations . \\nconsidering the serious nature of the film's theme - the importance of the united states' first amendment - the people vs . \\nlarry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light-hearted and humourous . \\nmuch of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt's outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances - some of his chosen apparel is hilarious - and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points , such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity . \\nthe film's focus is on the flynt's many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech , but the heart of the people vs . \\nlarry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea . \\nlarry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff , harsh , and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues , but with althea , we see his loving , affectionate side . \\nthere's a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking . \\nultimately , the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors , but from the strength of flynt and althea's love for each other . \\nwoody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a career-topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt . \\nharrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience , and a very compelling protagonist for the film . \\ncourtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn , completely raw and impulsive . \\nit's a very solid performance , brash and naturalistic , and love is extremely compelling ; it's difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen , and her chemistry with harrelson is dead-on . \\nedward norton , as flynt's straight , level-headed lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier co-stars in the people vs . \\nlarry flynt , much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes , but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film . \\none can sense the frustration that norton's character feels when harrelson's free-talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind , and this results in a heightened emotional punch when norton's isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges . \\nmilos forman keeps the film moving - although it runs over two hours , it never drags - and his direction of the film is very effective , eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic . \\nthere's also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot , which is both clever and extremely entertaining . \\ntwo minor quibbles with the film - it certainly seems like the people vs . \\nlarry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme , with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech . \\nconsequently , the first thirty minutes of the film , introducing and setting up the characters , seem unduly rushed ; perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting , but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion . \\nit also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters - the film clearly shows what flynt , althea , isaacman , and rev . jerry faldwell did , and on a superficial level some of their motivations , but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level . \\nfor example , why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton ( president carter's sister ) to be born-again is a mystery to me . \\nthen again , perhaps it was to him as well . \\nthese two points don't detract greatly from the film . \\nthe people vs . \\nlarry flynt is certainly among the very best studio-released films of 1996 , and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression , and as a touching love story . \\n\",\n",

       " b'after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project , making the third installment in the godfather-trilogy . \\nthis new film has been underrated for no reason . \\nit is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla\\'s pervious films . \\nit is also more psychological , pessimistic and more tragic than the first two . \\nthe only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some \" unfinished \" developments of some characters . \\nthe film elegantly begins with nino rota\\'s recognizable musical score , the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michael\\'s voice as he is writing a letter to his children : \" the only wealth in this world is children . \\nmore than all money and power on earth , you are my treasure \" . \\nthe year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of \" part ii \" to make his father\\'s dream come true - making the corleone family legitimate . \\nmichael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling . \\nconstantly haunted by the past , his only reason to live is his children . \\nthe family has amassed unimaginable wealth , and as the film opens michael corleone ( al pacino ) is being invested with a great honor by the church . \\nlater that day , at a reception , his daughter announces a corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily , \" a check in the amount of $100 million . \" \\nbut the corleones are about to find , as others have throughout history , that you cannot buy forgiveness . \\nsure , you can do business with evil men inside the church , for all men are fallible and capable of sin . \\nbut god does not take payoffs . \\nthe plot of the movie , concocted by coppola and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines , brings the corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the vatican . \\nthere is a moment in \" godfather iii \" where michael says : \" all my life i have been trying to go up in society , where everything was legal . \\nbut the higher i go , the crookier it becomes . . \" \\n . \\nvisually this film is as spectacular as the first two . \\ngordon willis\\' rich cinematography , carmine copolla\\'s beautiful composition and alex tavoularis\\' wonderful art direction could not be better . \\nbut copolla\\'s first two godfather-films were more famous for their deep , intellectual plots , tree dimensional characters and incredible acting , than for their visual perfection . \\nthe third installment has only the plot and visuals . \\nsome characters could be much more developed and the acting , although good , never accomplishes to reach the same height of the first two films . \\nthe biggest miscasting is sofia copolla , who is so unconvincing and unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie , that could have been grander and more emotional . \\nthe best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino , who should have got a nomination for best actor at the oscars . \\nandy garcia is powerful as sonny\\'s son , strong , focused and loyal . \\nviolence is natural to him . \\nhe suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his family\\'s behalf , and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone was . \\nhowever both kay ( diane keaton ) and connie ( talia shire ) are useless . \\nand characters like vito corleone and tom hagen are really missed . \\nthe good part is that michael is again reunited with old friends , that you remember from the first and second films . \\nin the third film michael has become almost like his father , vito in the first film and vincenzo resembles michael when he was much younger . \\nthis parallel could be more interesting if vincenzo\\'s character was more developed . \\nmany have pointed out that making the third film , was unnecessary . \\ni disagree . \\nit is a beautiful film of great importance , completing the tragic saga of the corleone family . \\nthe first film showed some horrible results of corleone\\'s life . \\nit showed michael making a choice ; the second showed a man damning himself for his choices and feeling the impact of changing times . \\na man desperately trying to keep his balance , focus , family and sanity , while everything is crashing all around him . \\nthe third film is a terrifying conclusion - a result of michael\\'s life . \\nthe life he chose for himself is like quicksand - one wrong step and you are doomed . \\nthere is no turning back . \\nand no matter how hard you try to get out of it , to free yourself , no matter how powerful and wealthy you are , you are helpless - sinking deeper and deeper till it swallows you completely . \\nthe beautifully directed last sequence is also the powerful climax of the film , when michael is sitting alone in his chair , left by everyone , surrounded by emptiness and memories of his friends and family members long dead . \\nhere he dies - alone , miserable and unforgiven \\n',\n",

       " b'the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now : \" it mu5t be found . \" \\nso what , exactly , is the fifth element ? \\nafter seeing luc besson\\'s ambitious , much-shrouded-in-secrecy science fiction fantasy , i could not help but be let down by the actual answer , which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think . \\nbut what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole , a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do--create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen . \\nthe biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps--the actual storyline--is the most conventional , dismayingly so , element ( pun intended ) of the film . \\nspeaking in the vaguest possible terms , the basics of the plot are as follows : in the year 2259 , a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth , and only the four elements--earth , wind , fire , and water--united with a fifth element can stop it . \\nfiguring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas ( bruce willis ) ; a shady , southern-drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg ( the hilariously hammy gary oldman , picking up where he left off in besson\\'s the professional ) ; a priest ( ian holm ) ; and a mysterious creature named leeloo ( milla jovovich ) . \\nall of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming--and unsurprising--fashion , but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest . \\nwhat remains interesting and exciting , however , after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil , director of photography thierry arbogast , visual effects supervisor mark stetson , and the crew at digital domain . \\nthe look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last . \\nthe frenzied cityscape of new york , with its vibrant day-glo colors , tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds , and the swarm of cars , cabs , and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways , is absolutely breathtaking to behold , especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film . \\nbut it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren\\'t equally as interesting , and are they ever . \\nin addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world , from bulky robots to dog-like mangalores , the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean-paul gaulthier , best known for creating madonna\\'s pointy bustier get-up in her blonde ambition tour . \\ngaulthier\\'s outlandish creations , such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps , feel more at home in besson\\'s futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world ; they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film . \\nwhile besson\\'s bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film , it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience . \\nfor all its imagination , certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre . \\ni really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film , ruby rhod ( chris tucker ) , a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative--he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress , sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer , speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed . \\nat first this character\\'s hyper energy is funny , but the act wears out its welcome very quickly . \\nnot irritating , but just as strange , is a musical number by blue-skinned alien chanteuse diva ( maiwenn lebesco ) , who sings--and dances--an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno . \\nthe tune , as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra\\'s innovative score , is haunting , but it is also completely jarring . \\nthen there are the campy touches of humor besson and co-scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout , which too often are silly and forced ; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny , to boot . \\nthe story\\'s weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element . \\nwhile still visually and aurally spectacular , the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be . \\nthe big , serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers , and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward . \\nas such , at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here , that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters . \\nthis suspicion was confirmed by besson himself , who told me in the lobby following the screening ( imagine that , the filmmaker watching the film with the \" enemy \" --the critics ) that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half--now titled mr . shadow--is still waiting to be made . \\nstill , despite the story problems , the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson ;

       " b'the ultimate match up between good and evil , \" the untouchables \" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry . \\nbased on the 1959 television show of the same title , \" the untouchables \" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script . \\nthe film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public . \\nelliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order . \\nhowever , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws . \\nthe fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes . \\nthe film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws . \\nthe film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone\\'s men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl . \\nfrom this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard . \\nright from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs . \\nthis developed hatred is before the film\\'s hero , ness , is even introduced . \\ni found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone . \\nthe film only gets better from this point . \\nwith the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats . \\nthey walk in unison and they only look forward . \\nas they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens . \\nholding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films . \\none that comes to mind is \" the matrix \" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world . \\nwearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930\\'s style , the similarities between these two are countless . \\n \" the untouchables \" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film . \\nthe four members were the only ones willing to go against capone\\'s army . \\neach member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others . \\nelliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film . \\nhe begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be . \\nhowever , as the film develops so does ness . \\nhis beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side . \\nhe also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends . \\nhis anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in . \\nsean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables . \\nmalone acts as a mentor to ness . \\nhe teaches him \" the chicago way \" to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun . \\nconnery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed . \\nandy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer . \\nas ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him . \\ncharles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone . \\nsmith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film . \\nthe action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen . \\nalso very similar to \" the matrix , \" they are exciting and intense . \\n>from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed . \\nthe score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement . \\nits pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors . \\nthe combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective . \\nalthough the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action . \\nsome scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid . \\n',\n",

       " b'showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven , director , and joe eszterhas , writer . \\ntheir last effort , basic instinct , played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock , with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry-spiced tabasco sauce ; a dish not to everyone\\'s taste , but certainly a well-crafted movie . \\npossibly that movie\\'s greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage , prior to the movie , during the movie , and after the movie . . . \\nand that , after bringing all the plotlines together neatly , it left the viewer with full knowledge of what * would * happen in the characters\\' future , so there was no need to film it . \\nthere was actually about four hours\\' worth of screen story there , but eszterhas found ways to get it all on-screen in two , by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on ; and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails . \\nthe major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls . \\nwe have attractive , sympathetic , but still highly repellent characters ; we have shows for the eyes and the ears , plotlines that play on several levels , we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable , and we have a story of an innocent ( who may not be so innocent ) who\\'s trying to play straight , trying to improve her station in life , who slips into behaving the way those around her do . . . \\nbut recovers with a flourish , and quits a winner . \\nin this sense , the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven , who\\'s not known for treating his characters well ; but nomi , the part played by elizabeth berkley , definitely opts out of the game in a positive way , and we\\'re left feeling good about her future . \\nthis is not one of the great movies , but it\\'s far better than we\\'d been led to expect by all the negative pre-release publicity . \\nverhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 , and in the last quarter-century has pushed farther and farther , experimenting with the socially-acceptable limits to movie-making . \\nhis most recent three movies , robocop , total recall , and basic instinct , have been a progression of back-door access to american culture , moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives ; and now he\\'s exploring the sleeze . \\nthis movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director\\'s contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie . \\n ( verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating , although his original version is available on video . ) \\nmany reviewers have taken the politically-correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing ; but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies , it\\'s about people in an environment where naked ladies are common , and why such an environment should exist . \\nit\\'s about the scum who use other people as power-trip toys , and the need to escape their power . \\nit\\'s about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don\\'t pertain ; and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment . \\nan nc-17 movie which isn\\'t sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty , power , or value . \\nthe one scene in the movie that * could * have been a good sex scene , berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool , is not exciting , because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator . \\nif anything , it\\'s a rape scene with a victim who\\'s been duped into cooperation . \\nyou don\\'t make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors ; you don\\'t make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed ; and you don\\'t make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls . . . \\nand in an awful lot of vegas shows , an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing . \\nthis is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry , in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity . \\nshowgirls de-glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness . \\nnomi is played , in a very good performance , by elizabeth berkley , who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who\\'s at the end of her rope , desperate to live a life better than the one she\\'s known . \\nshe has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability , and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker , trying to be something better than she seems destined to be . \\nwhen nomi realizes she\\'s gone too far for too little , she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be . \\ngina rivera plays molly , a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi , providing her with what may be the one solid , positive relationship in nomi\\'s entire life . \\nmolly is the one who makes the difference , and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she\\'ll be using for the rest of her life , and nomi\\'s feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi\\'s decision . \\ngina gershon plays cristal , an aging , but still very attractive starring dancer , a reflexively competitive manipulator who\\'s become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her . \\ngershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch ; a fading talent made bitter by self-awareness . \\nher character is very well drawn and performed ; in a major scene in a hospital room , she acknowledges what she is , and , in essence , passes the torch to nomi . \\nthe relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie , and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path . \\nit is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe ; molly is an honest , hard-working person who means well , and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality . \\ncristal is a talented dancer who\\'s compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a co-operating part of the system , exchanging self-respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas . \\nnomi believes she can make it without selling herself , succumbs to a degree , and then realizes she can make it without selling herself , and doesn\\'t need las vegas or its brand of \" stardom . \" \\nthe male parts in this movie are simply props ; they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist . \\nkyle maclachlan , whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden , gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs , camouflaged as a nice guy . \\nglenn plummer plays a dancer who\\'s working as a bellboy , and provides a bit of alternate perspective . \\nplummer\\'s character is the only one in the movie who\\'s maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art , but even he\\'s succumbed to the cult of manipulation . \\nplummer\\'s character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie . \\nsome of jost vacano\\'s cinematography is fantastic , and one particular delineation of nomi\\'s character alteration , a no-dialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting , is utterly terrifying . \\nthis movie is rated nc-17 due to language , sexual situations , full frontal nudity , violence , and probably the costuming as well . \\ni don\\'t see a way this particular story could have been told well without it , and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie-making . \\nbut don\\'t go see it if you\\'re not in a tough mood ;

       " b'at first glance , daylight would seem like your typical disaster movie . \\non second glance it looks that way too . \\nalthough , as typical disaster movies go , daylight isn\\'t that bad . \\nadmittedly , it seems to rip off a great deal of its plot devices from disaster flicks of days gone by ( think poseidon adventure ) . \\nbut the decent dialogue and surprisingly good acting make up for the \" haven\\'t i seen this scene somewhere before ? \" \\nfeeling that creeps up all too often during the film . \\nsylvester stallone stars as the recently fired head of new york\\'s emergency response team . \\nby sheer luck , he is in the right place at the right time when disaster strikes the unaware inhabitants of this little film . \\n \" what disaster is that ? \" \\nyou ask , as you inch ever closer to the edge of your seat . \\nglad you asked . \\nthrough a whole sequence of entirely probable events ( about as probable as hitting the lottery ) a large explosion takes place in the lincoln tunnel running under the hudson river in new york city . \\nthe explosion results in the tunnel collapsing at both ends , which causes not only massive loss of life , but traps a dozen people inside the wreckage of the tunnel . \\ngood old sly , who is only feet away from entering the tunnel when it collapses , offers his services to the rescuers , who gladly accept it . \\nsly then enters the tunnel through a vent shaft ( think judge dredd ) which he can only go in , and not out off , and proceeds to try to rescue those trapped inside . \\nso begins the fun , but the fun has to be quick , because this tunnel has started to spring a leak . \\nthe acting is about what you would expect of a stallone movie . \\nnot superb by any means , but far above some of his other films ( think judge dredd again ) . \\ndaylight\\'s acting is probably average , or a little above , in terms of this sort of genre , starring this particular star . \\namy brenneman is the only actor of any note , and she does a pretty good job as stallone\\'s reluctant helper . \\noh yeah , stallone\\'s real life son , sage , is in this too . \\nsage -- nice name . \\ni guess it could be worse , he could have been named nutmeg or parsley . \\nnote to sage -- you are still young . \\ngo to school and get a good education -- you don\\'t have a future in acting . \\nthe plot runs along the same lines as the acting -- interesting , but predictable . \\nmostly due to the fact that it was pretty well recycled from a dozen other action flicks . \\nthe biggest problem with a film of this nature is that they try to cram too many things into the movie . \\nas soon as the cast clears one seemingly impossible hurdle , another one seems to pop right up , even worse than the last one . \\ni realize that it wouldn\\'t be much of a movie otherwise , but it does make the movie a bit predictable . \\nadding to the predictability is the cast of characters , which of course , has to include at least one or two difficult people who want to do things their own way and think the qualified guy ( in this case stallone ) doesn\\'t know what he is doing . \\nwhy is it in disaster movies we can never have everyone agree with each other and all work together ? \\nwould this be too much to ask ? \\ncan\\'t we all just get along ? \\nspecial effects weren\\'t bad -- but i\\'ve certainly seen better . \\nsome of the scenes , while fun to watch , were such blatant rip-offs that you had to wonder if scripts from old movies were just copied verbatim . \\nespecially all of the scenes that involved anything underwater ( the tunnel , of course , starts to flood ) . \\ni really expected gene hackman , roddy mcdowell and ernest borgnine to appear at any minute -- i wasn\\'t sure if i was watching daylight or the poseidon adventure . \\ni suppose if you have to rip off a movie for good ideas , the poseidon adventure is a good one to use . \\nthe underwater sequences ( aside from the deja vu ) were very well shot and worked fairly well . \\nthey were the best part of the movie by a long shot . \\nbetter than average stallone flick . \\ni realize that\\'s not saying much when the man has judge dredd on his resume . \\nbut certainly not up to the standards of cliffhanger . \\ndaylight is a fun movie , and as long as you aren\\'t expecting a whole lot you might even be pleasantly surprised . \\n',\n",
       " b\"summer movies are , by nature , dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money . \\nwild wild west , the latest will smith affair , follows much the same formula , except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies . \\nwill smith plays jim west , a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses . \\nhe is called by president grant ( kline ) to go on a mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing . \\nwest is paired up with scientist artemus gordon ( kline again ) and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind , named dr . loveless ( branagh , with a zany moustache . ) \\nbefore i pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair , i'll give it a chance with the positives . \\nthere's a nice credit sequence , the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye , and the special effects are decent enough . \\nthere's also a pleasant soundtrack . \\nburied deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes . \\nand salma hayek pops up as the female interest , which is always nice to see . \\napart from these factors , though , nothing else in wild wild west works . \\nfirstly , there's little chemistry between smith and kline , who appears to be in it purely for the money . \\none would expect zingers passing between the two : none arise . \\nboth of them plod through the below standard plot , knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end . \\nnot even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment : although he is over the top , the material doesn't present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy . \\ntherefore , he just comes across as loud as obnoxious . \\nthe only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek , who is given so little screen time it's embarrassing . \\nshe appears to be in the film to merely show off her body , and be ogled at by kline and smith . \\nher character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script , and there is no sense of realism about the character . \\nthe 'humour' in the film is also very off . \\nwill smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black , here , not even smith could save the humour on display . \\nthe script largely boils down to insults that aren't very funny , and one-liners that barely raise a smirk . \\nit's also somewhat racist , although it doesn't intend to be , with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching , and actually says slavery is good to save himself . \\nit's not a funny scene , and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably . \\nthe film also makes the tragic mistake that a man ( in this case kline ) in a dress is automatically unfunny , it isn't , but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness . \\nthere's also problems with the plot . \\njim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations , but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying , and rely purely on luck , rather than audience pleasing skill . \\nplot elements are introduced into the film , and then thrown away just as quickly . \\nthe main piece of the story , a 80 foot mechanical , steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive , but there's no particular reason why it should be built . \\nwhy not loveless build a great big tank , instead of an ungainly , fragile piece of machinery that's just begging to be blown up ? \\ndirector barry sonnenfeld always has a breezy look to them , with some nice camera tricks , but even this is missing from this stilted affair . \\nwild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing , but not much of it is evident , making this film drag out even more . \\nit's a sad thing when _four_ ( credited ) screenwriters , a talented director and a willing star can't make a film work , and eventually wild wild west collapses under it's sexist , mildly racist , unfunny weight . \\n\",\n",
       " b'now that \" boogie nights \" has made disco respectable again ( well , fashionable at least ) , we shouldn\\'t be surprised to see more films glorifying that dubious era . \\nthe latest art house interpretation is whit stillman\\'s \" the last days of disco . \" \\nstillman , who made \" metropolitan \" and \" barcelona \" using some of the same actors , uses disco\\'s final hours to highlight what is another conversation-heavy movie that benefits from typically astute writing from the director . \\nthe young , upwardly-mobile professional ( don\\'t call them yuppies ! ) \\nmen and women of \" the last days of disco \" frequent a prestigious new york city nightclub pulsating to the bass-pounding rhythms of earth wind and fire , amy grant , and andrea true connection . \\nhere they talk and talk and talk , intellectualizing about such things as dating , success , and being liked , accepted , and admired . \\nif talk is cheap , \" the last days of disco \" must surely have been an extremely inexpensive movie to shoot . \\nwhat makes the film so entertaining is that this preppie , harvard-educated jet set actually have something to say and say it with wit , perception , and style ( including , at one point , a riotously inventive deconstruction of \" the lady and the tramp \" ) . \\nna ? ve alice ( chlo ? sevigny ) and sophisticated charlotte ( kate beckinsale ) are recent college graduates who work as assistant editors for a new york publishing house . \\ncharlotte is confident and outspoken--perhaps a little too outspoken ; alice is shy and introverted , \" like a kindergarten teacher . \" \\nthe two friends often doll themselves up and head out to the nameless nightspot , looking good and looking for excitement ( and that ms . beckinsale sure looks good on a dancefloor ! ) . \\nhere they meet , or re-meet , a variety of eligible men , many of whom they knew in college . \\ndes ( played by stillman favorite christopher eigeman ) is one of the club\\'s managers whose job is on the line for sneaking his ad agency buddies in the back . \\ndes has reached a crisis point in his life : he just found out--last wednesday , in fact--that he\\'s gay . \\nwhether it\\'s true or not , it makes for a convenient excuse to dump his latest girlfriend ( jennifer beals in a small but soul-baring turn ) . \\ncharlotte observes cattily that the only gay thing about des is his mouth . \\njimmy ( mackenzie astin ) is the advertising exec who , by the end of the picture , winds up heading for a new job opportunity in spain ( visions of \" barcelona \" ? ) . \\njosh ( matt keeslar ) is an assistant district attorney who dreams of being able to say , just once , \" book this clown ! \" \\nand robert sean leonard plays another one of alice\\'s revolving suitors ; the two have an amusing exchange about the true definition of virginity . \\nany film that can make robert sean leonard palatable is worthy of respect in my book . \\nin fact , the entire ensemble is appealing in that well-spoken stillman way . \\nwhile the eschewing of \" ferocious pairing \" is a favored topic of conversation in the film , the protagonists tend to slip in and out of love , lust , and trouble with each other in an emotional merry-go-round that cleverly develops its characters through the \" preferred \" dynamics of social group interaction . \\nmore mature than stillman\\'s previous two films , \" the last days of disco \" is as consistently droll as it is stimulating . \\nit\\'s a movie you should definitely get on down to . \\n',\n",

ki often matches the colour of characters\\' clothes with the background colour and/or lighting , so that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the environment . \\nthere is no suggestion of sexuality in the relationship ; ilona and lauri sleep in separate beds and their gestures of affection lack the heat of desire ; their lives are now bound by something more complex and desperate than love . \\ntheir downward , downsized , downtrodden lives have a momentum that is almost comic , as one setback succeeds another , bottoming out when lauri stakes all their remaining money on the spin of a roulette wheel . \\nit must have been tempting to play the story for more laughs , more farce , more deadpan wit , but the film\\'s great strength is the sober , empathic manner in which it observes lauri and ilona\\'s misfortunes . \\nirony would be an injustice . \\nsituations and settings are broad and exaggerated--this is not realism--but they are not distorted . \\nthe emotions are authentic . \\nif it is difficult to laugh at anything that happens , despite the droll performances , the laconic humour , that\\'s because kaurism ? ki brings such compassion and understanding to the manifold indignities that are suffered . \\nhe shows us how humiliating it must be for a woman of thirty-eight , who has worked long and hard to win a respectable position , to be forced to accept a job as a dishwasher in a two-bit restaurant ; how humiliating it must be for a man nearing 50 to confront his wife\\'s former employer , demanding the rest of her wages , only to have the crap beaten out of him , unable to land a single punch , when the employer and his cronies refuse to give him the money . \\nall this is observed keenly , with great economy : every cut , every line of dialogue , is judicious . \\nif most films are novelistic in their telling , this one brings the focus and concentration of a short story to bear . \\nbut what is gained in nuance and acumen is rather undermined by the sense that the material barely accommodates the 96-minute running length . \\ni have seen many movies far less profound , less humane , less necessary than drifting clouds , but they filled me with an urge to watch them again , and this one did not . \\nit does not need to be seen twice : its every detail and implication can be absorbed in one viewing . \\nit is not a movie that will be seen by a large audience , because it cannot be pitched to one . \\nthere is no selling point . \\nit is all understatement , restraint , melancholy . \\nthe characters are unremarkable , their best years behind them , their dreams dissipated ; it takes all the effort they can muster just to pay the bills . \\nthis does not make them less fascinating , merely less marketable , which is a shame , because this is a movie which should be seen , precisely because it pays attention to people and emotions that most movies prefer to ignore . \\nit engages us and touches us and resolves--surprisingly , and movingly--into something resembling a happy ending . \\nthe only thing greater than the ill-luck that governs the characters\\' lives is their refusal to give in to despair . \\ntheir persistence is rewarded with what might be called a \" feel-good \" ending elsewhere , but not here , because this ending differs in kind from most such endings : this one has truly been earned . \\n',\n",

       " b'gere , willis , poitier chase each other around the world \\nthe jackal a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman \\nwhen the soviet union imploded , the western countries lost their shadow . \\nwith the united states friendly with the russians , we no longer had an entity to blame for the world\\'s problems . \\nthis showed up in hollywood films as the communist government was no longer the easy bad guy . \\nit\\'s time to rejoice because we\\'ve found our new villain . \\nnow it\\'s no longer the russian government who sends killers out into foreign lands , it\\'s the russian _mafia_ . \\na perfect solution , it combines the dread of organized crime and the still-present uneasiness with the former eastern block countries . \\nbest of all , the villains are still foreigners : fear of the other always plays best . \\nso it is a crime lord in moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal ( bruce willis ) to assassinate a highly placed us government figure in retaliation for the death of his brother during a nightclub raid . \\nthe fbi is at a loss as to how to protect the target from someone they\\'re not sure even exists . \\ncoming to their rescue is former ira operative declan mulqueen ( richard gere ) who is temporarily released from prison to assist fbi agent carter preston ( sidney poitier ) and russian major valentina koslova ( diane venora ) . \\nmulqueen\\'s ex-girlfriend basque terrorist isabella ( mathilda may ) is the only person who has seen the elusive jackal . \\n ( presumably there is an exclusive international terrorist club somewhere where the three met . ) \\nthe film follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares for his $70 million hit and mulqueen attempts to locate him while preston makes sure that the irishman doesn\\'t slip away . \\ncrossing numerous borders and donning various disguises for both himself and his mini-van , the killer is always one step ahead of his pursuers . \\nbeing very loosely based on the same book the 1973 thriller \" the day of the jackal \" , comparison between the two films is inevitable . \\nthere is no doubt that the original is the better movie , playing the story for suspense rather than the current action/adventure . \\nas a mystery , \" the jackal \" has enough holes in it to ruin the tale , but if you can accept it for what it is , there\\'s entertainment to be had . \\nholes ? let\\'s see ? a pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure that he must possess psychic powers to pick it up . \\nfor a 20-year veteran that can command the big bucks , the jackal is an incredibly poor shot . \\nthe final scene between gere and willis occurs in a location that should be mobbed with police , but it\\'s just the two of them . \\nwillis\\' disguises usually look like bruce willis and are just as interesting as val kilmer\\'s in \" the saint \" . \\n ( and lest you misunderstand , that\\'s not a compliment . ) \\nbut the three stars are fun to watch . \\nit\\'s good to see gere in something other than a business suit . \\nwillis has a mixed history in picking projects , but his characters are always watchable . \\npoitier is by far the superior actor , but has limited screen time . \\nthe problems in logic are flaws , but don\\'t ruin the experience . \\noccasionally there are movies that transcend their blemishes . \\nthis is one of them . \\n[the appeared in the 11/20/97 \" bloomington voice \" , bloomington , indiana] \\n',\n",
       " b\"let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn't looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films . \\ni'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years . \\ni'm happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film . \\nby that point , it was evident that mr . bond was back with a vengeance . \\nall doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience . \\nit seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts . \\nit took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in . \\ni guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain . \\nanyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond . \\ni think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films . \\nthere were probably more one-liners in this movie than in the last several combined . \\nand bond's last one-liner in the film is about the best of the series . \\nthe world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series . \\neverything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007 . \\nfor the most part , the action sequences worked very well . \\nalthough , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film . \\ni think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted . \\nwhile he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film . \\nmost noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie . \\nhe almost seemed like he didn't know what he was doing . \\nbut they were brief scenes and really shouldn't take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing . \\nif you have ever seen a bond film , you won't be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit . \\nthe world is not enough is no exception . \\nthis time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world . \\n007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) , a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain . \\nwhy this point is included is beyond me . \\nthey took great pains to explain his condition , but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought . \\nanyway , renard , like the typical terrorist that he is , is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid-east oil pipeline . \\ni guess world domination just isn't as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore . \\nbond is brought in to protect the pipeline's owner , elektra king ( sophie marceau ) , who is the daughter of one of renard's recent victims . \\nalong the way , bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist , dr . christmas jones ( denise richards ) , and his old rival valentin zukovsky ( robert carlyle ) . \\nlike all bond films , you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot , since it is ridiculous beyond words . \\nmy biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films . \\nthere was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing . \\nthe buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau's character . \\nit was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in the film . \\nlater , it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something . \\nbut because it is a bond film , the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly . \\nafter all , it isn't shakespeare . \\nhow about the cast ? \\nbrosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007 . \\ni grew up with the roger moore version of bond , so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character . \\njudi dench , as m , had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role . \\nshe brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner . \\nrobbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye , so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie . \\ncoltrane gets more screen time , which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes . \\nthen there are the bond girls . \\nsophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today . \\nthere is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim . \\nthose that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face . \\nmarceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest . \\nthen we have denise richards . \\nthere was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks . \\nand after you see the outfits she wears , you won't have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer's eyes . \\ni was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist . \\nadmittedly , there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue , but other than that she stacks up ( no pun intended ) to her bond girl predecessors nicely . \\ni must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle's character . \\nwhile carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had , his character just never worked for me . \\nthe producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character , but it just never quite got off the ground . \\ni guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character , but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character . \\nthis might have worked well in another movie , but i don't go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations . \\nlast , but not least , we have desmond llewelyn as q . this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn as bond's gadget guy , and he is as good as ever . \\nalthough his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films , he is still a treat to watch . \\nrumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role . \\nhe says future appearances are up to a higher power . \\nthe producers have introduced his protege and future replacement , a bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese . \\nwhile we don't see much of him in this film , i think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyn's legacy , whenever it is passed on , will be in very capable hands . \\nso how does it stack up ? \\ndespite some problems , the world is not enough is a very entertaining movie . \\nand , all things considered , what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies . \\nthis is easily the best of the brosnan films . \\nit may even be the best of the entire series , certainly in the top 3 . \\none thing is for sure , even after 19 movies , there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series . \\nhere's looking forward to bond number 20 . \\n\",\n",
       " b'after a successful run in australia last year , and with much critical praise heaped upon it , muriel\\'s wedding opens into medium release this weekend in north america . \\nmuriel heslop is a withdrawn , overweight young woman living in porpoise spit , australia . \\nshe is often the target of her father\\'s frequent rants at the family , and drowns out her feelings of inadequacy with abba music and fantasies of marriage . \\nher self-loathing is such that only being wed shall she prove herself to be a success ; marriage will transform her into a new person who is respected and admired . \\nafter her four cliquey friends dump her , muriel plots to follow them to a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of the girls , and muriel\\'s wedding unfolds from there . \\ntoni collette plays muriel in a winning performance , conveying both the sadness of her character and her desperate eagerness to be accepted . \\ncollette gained a frightening 43 pounds in order to play the chubby title character . \\nshe has a natural screen presence and exudes charisma , easily winning the audience over with an honest , painful performance . \\ncollette basically carries the film , appearing in almost every scene . \\nmuriel\\'s father , bill \" the battler \" heslop , is portrayed by bill hunter as a slick politician/developer . \\nwhile chumming around with young fans and crowing \\'you can\\'t beat progress\\' ( his slogan ) , bill labels his family as worthless and embarrassments . \\nrachel griffiths plays rhonda , who becomes muriel\\'s cheeky new friend in the film . \\nshe has good chemistry with collette , and the film suffers when griffiths is off-screen . \\nmuriel\\'s tormenters , played by pippa grandison , rosalind hammond , belinda jarrett and sophie lee , are two-dimensional caricatures , all saucy , vain and bumblingly spiteful , though that is probably due to hogan\\'s scripting \\nmuriel\\'s wedding is essentially a genre teen comedy with more intelligence and a lot of charm . \\nhogan\\'s use of abba tunes ( which virtually comprises the entire soundtrack ) is interestingly appropriate , although its repetitiveness tires after awhile . \\nhogan\\'s script is right on the mark in terms of proportionately mixing comedy with muriel\\'s earnest quest for acceptance , and the gorgeous scene with muriel window-shopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marriage has for her . \\nthe glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch . \\nmuriel\\'s wedding features a fine performance by toni collette and a charming , if a bit too straightforward and conventional story by p . j . hogan . \\non my four star scale , i give muriel\\'s wedding three stars . \\n',\n",
       " b' \" deep rising \" gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively : not only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by a squid-like menace , but the unfolding story is artificial , silly and almost completely derivative of countless other ( and , for the most part , better ) films . \\nwhile dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures -- take , for example , the schlocky mountain highs of last spring\\'s \" anaconda \" -- \" deep rising \" has no tongue to put in its cheek . \\nfolks , we\\'re only a month into the new year , and already here\\'s a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases . \\nmost of the action takes place on the argonautica , a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage ( uh-oh -- if these people had seen \" titanic , \" then maybe they\\'d have known to stay home ) when it\\'s attacked by a giant , tentacled sea creature . \\nthe only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian ( famke janssen ) , argonautica owner canton ( anthony heald ) and a few other crew members . \\na mercenary team , lead by resourceful captain john finnegan ( treat williams ) , board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby . \\nbut what their search of the ship uncovers is something blood-soaked , hungry and not very helpful . \\nthe main problem with \" deep rising \" is its overt familiarity ; the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci-fi/horror films in recent memory . \\nthe concept is \" leviathan \" meets \" titanic , \" with a dash of \" speed 2 \" thrown in for good ( or is that bad ? ) \\nmeasure . \\nthis monster is equal parts \" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea \" and \" the relic , \" knows how to open doors like the raptors from \" jurassic park \" and even gets to expel a half-digested victim ( a neat effect , admittedly ) a la the giant snake in \" anaconda . \" \\nsome of the attack sequences are straight out of \" jaws \" and \" alien . \" \\na scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of \" alien resurrection . \" \\nthere\\'s even a jet ski chase like \" hard rain . \" \\nand the list goes on . \\nwatching \" deep rising \" \\'s cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself , because none of them have well-developed characters , nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy . \\nwilliams is affable enough , but his finnegan just isn\\'t believable . \\nan interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted ; pretty famke janssen , best known as \" goldeneye \" \\'s killer thighs , is trapped in a forced romantic interest with williams , while kevin j . o\\'connor , as finnegan\\'s mechanic , provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast . \\ndjimon honsou , who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in december\\'s \" amistad , \" pops up in a brief part . \\nhe needs to stay away from the water . \\nthe movie\\'s final shot is a groaner , as is the 11th-hour regurgitation of a subplot involving an on-ship saboteur . \\nas if a cast deserving of their snack food-fate isn\\'t bad enough ( when you taunt the monster , you\\'re really asking for it ) , \" deep rising \" is a slow , stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot . \\nand since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is , the closer we are to the end of the movie , rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isn\\'t out of the question . \\n',\n",

       " b\"synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners . \\ncinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves . \\ntechnically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn't be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave . \\nlawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men . \\nthree lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close-ups , big music , and dramatic imagery . \\na final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters . \\nopinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life . \\nin fiction , one invents purposeful , clear-cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion . \\nreal life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved . \\nspielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story . \\ndjimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances . \\n\",\n",
       " b'for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and \" high art , \" the son\\'s room is an inventive , subtle alternative . \\nwritten by , directed , and starring nanni moretti , it takes us through the slow , complicated path of bereavement . \\nslow is the best description for the film at first . \\nit takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal , happy family . \\nfather and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities . \\nthey laugh , spend free time together , and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder . \\nyou get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome . \\nbut suddenly , the son is found to be dead after a diving accident . \\nthe family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it , but can also be trying on the attention span . \\nthough the film drags and even repeats itself , this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving . \\nthough nanni moretti wore several hats for this production , it doesn\\'t come across as a vanity piece . \\none might wish he hadn\\'t picked the profession of analyst for the father , giovanni ( which he stars as ) , if only because this makes his character\\'s reactions so predictable . \\nwhat saves it is a well written script , with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction . \\nthe potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative , or that remind a depressed person of loss . \\nyou start to take notice of the cracked dishes , ignored when familial bliss was in full swing . \\nyou remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block , and not necessarily huge events like graduation . \\neven better are the role reversals that take place within the household . \\nwhile giovanni and paola ( laura morante ) do check up on their daughter irene ( jasmine trinca ) , there is a sense of being on autopilot . \\nnot only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more , she\\'ll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them . \\nthese scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms , frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic , unexpected change . \\nrespectfully , gender issues never enter the picture . \\nself-propelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing , so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family . \\nthough giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends , there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic , or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives . \\nmost films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama , speeches , and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing . \\nin contrast , the son\\'s room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning ( denial , depression , anger , bargaining , acceptance ) through each of its main characters . \\nit\\'s not the most engaging 100 minutes , but it is certainly easy to relate to . \\n',\n",

       " b\"ingredients : down-on-his-luck evangelist , church \\nsynopsis : sonny dewey ( robert duvall ) is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife ( farrah fawcett ) in bed with another guy . \\nin a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy's head , and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder , and estranged from his wife and two kids . \\nto atone for his sins , sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature - - the apostle e . f . as the apostle e . f . sonny's main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station . \\nsoon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple . \\nbut sonny knows his time is short ; one day the police will find him . \\nopinion : this movie is a thought-provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms . \\ni believe that robert duvall ( who is the producer , director , writer , and main star of the apostle ) deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader - - a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film . \\nduvall's portrayal of a true believer is authentic , superb , and inspired ; it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion , as well as a portrait of a fallible , complicated man driven by his beliefs . \\nincidentally , in real life duvall was just as 'driven' in getting the project underway . \\nsince no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist , the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done , paying for its production with his own money ( about five million dollars ) . \\nin terms of hard-hitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade , and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film . \\nsimilarly , those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thought-provoking experience . \\non the other hand , the apostle's main strength - - duvall's preaching - - is also what limits the apostle's target audience . \\nin terms of plot and pure entertainment value , the apostle is definitely not for everyone . \\nteenagers , action fans , comedy fans , and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie , since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church . \\nin other words , the apostle is a four star performance , but with a very limited audience . \\n\",\n",
       " b' \" desperate measures \" is a generic title for a film that\\'s beyond generic . \\nit\\'s also a depressing waste of talent , with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles , not to mention once-cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not-cool flicks -- this thriller is more \" before and after \" than \" reversal of fortune . \" \\nthe movie is a big disappointment , and yet it\\'s somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it -- the premise is both promising and intriguing . \\ntoo bad the execution\\'s all wrong , though , because the set-up of \" desperate measures \" boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use . \\nsan francisco cop frank connor ( garcia ) is a single parent with a troubling dilemma -- his son matt ( joseph cross ) is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission . \\neven worse , the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe ( michael keaton ) , currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society . \\nconnor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery ; he\\'s at first reluctant , but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital . \\nwhen he does make a run for it , connor offers close pursuit , but for different reasons than his superiors ( including the crusty brian cox ) -- they want to take mccabe down , while connor needs to keep him alive , or all hope is lost for his little boy . \\none misstep \" desperate measures \" makes is in its underdevelopment of matt\\'s illness . \\nwhat\\'s needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works ; there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country , and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow . \\ntake , for example , a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital . \\nthe police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him , and what does connor do ? \\nhe shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight . \\nconnor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of , and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son . \\nwhatever . \\nto be fair , though , the lack of story background is the least of the movie\\'s problems . \\nfirst and foremost is how cheaply \" desperate measures \" trades the potential of it\\'s opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour . \\nonce mccabe escapes , the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills . \\nthere are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away . \\nalso , the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot-inducing , lip-smacking villain ( the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter , natch ) that it completely casts garcia\\'s frank connor by the dullsville wayside ; \" desperate measures \" appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist , and the movie\\'s head-scratcher of a send-off confirms this . \\nthere is some good to be found amongst this mess , particularly in the acting department . \\ncast against type , michael keaton\\'s understated menace is highly effective . \\nalthough he\\'s not given much believable to work with , andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord . \\njoseph cross , as garicia\\'s ailing son , is surprisingly unsentimental , and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos . \\nthis cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending , but most is lost . \\nit goes without saying that \" desperate measures \" needs an operation of its very own . \\n',\n",
       " b\"martin scorsese's kundun , which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama , has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure . \\npersonally , i don't think it needs one : it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china . \\nscorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do , as a larger-than-life symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership : the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences , but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal . \\nthe set design and cinematography are outstanding , and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle , it helps to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china to meet chairman mao . \\npolitical art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start shouting slogans , kundun does not : it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative . \\n\",\n",

s by conveying the feel of authentic experience , the intensity of lived pain , and much of it seems trite and belaboured . \\nit unfolds , awkwardly , as a series of flashbacks , told during a luncheon in vienna , where jia-li meets her brother\\'s old flame ( teresa hu ) , now a concert pianist , whom she has not seen since college . \\nboth women seem rather sad , and resigned to their sadness . \\ntheir circumstances ( and those of jia-li\\'s brother and a college friend ) suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices--married the wrong man , chosen the wrong career path , etc . --but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate . \\nit is not that jia-li married the wrong man ; she didn\\'t . \\nthe problem is that she needed to marry at all--and that if she did not marry , she would still be just as unhappy . \\nfor a woman in modern taiwan , that day tells us , the cards are stacked , the dice are loaded : she can play the game , but the house always wins . \\nthe film\\'s sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan . \\nseen now , it does not seem provocative . \\nindeed , it\\'s hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy : it may be ambitious , it may be innovative , but it is also terribly , terribly dull . \\nand what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us : yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others , and his use of those methods is fumbling , uncertain , undisciplined . \\nnor does he bring anything new--other than the locale--to the material . \\nthere are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives for--in a young couple\\'s first kiss , in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husband\\'s mistress--but they are brief . \\ntoo often , yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes--grocery shopping , flower-arranging--in which nothing happens , little is said , no emotion imparted . \\nperhaps , if the film were content to focus on such reflective , inward moments , leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings , it might have been ambiguous , suggestive , insinuating . \\nbut jia-li and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence : they talk about their problems , at length , in detail , redundantly , and eliminate all subtleties . \\nat two hours and forty-five minutes , it all seems exorbitantly long , indulgently long-winded . \\nconsider the defining moment for jia-li , the titular day on the beach . \\nthe thrust of the whole film explains , easily enough , what we are to think of that moment , what it means when she walks away from a particular situation . \\neven so , the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally , in case we may have missed the point . \\nneedless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed , and that is the problem throughout . \\nthe look of the film is as tedious as the drawn-out narrative . \\nit was the first feature shot by christopher doyle--at least , it\\'s his name in the credits--who is now rightly regarded as one of the world\\'s leading cinematographers . \\nin the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong kar-wai , he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image . \\nyou would never know it from watching that day , which , due either to doyle\\'s inexperience or yang\\'s humdrum direction , is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible . \\nin scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage , that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience , but none of the damage , none of the heartbreak . \\n',\n",

       " b'i swear i have seen the edge before . \\nin fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film . \\nhowever , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot . \\nin doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker . \\nunfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film . \\nbut leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head . \\none surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script . \\naction films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence . \\neven horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them all . \\nthe river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s . \\nthe intelligence of the screenplay , and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day . \\nthe edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall . \\ni must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes . \\nthis is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world ) . \\nif only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes\\' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely ) . \\nthe edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film . \\nbut taking scream\\'s lead , the edge makes fun of the genre\\'s cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively ) . \\ncharles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character , a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him . \\nfor once , we don\\'t immediately care for the main character . \\ninstead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles\\' wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness . \\nthey board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic . \\ncharles\\' birthday is the same day , and he receives a gold watch from his wife , and a pocket knife from bob . \\nas action films go , these items do have importance to the rest of the story , but quite a bit more than we first expect . \\nsoon , however , bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his \" personality . \" \\ncharles , bob , bob\\'s assistant steve ( harold perrineau ) , and the pilot head off to find him , and as shown in the previews , hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter . \\ndown the plane goes , the pilot is killed , and the three are left to survive in the wilderness . \\ndirector lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow , and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations . \\nhe succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film . \\ntake , for instance , the entire man-hunting bear plot . \\nthis has been done many times in films with different animals , and even bears . \\nbut given the charles\\' intelligence , and bob\\'s uncertainty , many of the cliches are given fresh twists . \\neven charles himself seems to have seen these action films before . \\nmy favorite line of the film comes from charles : \" most people die in the wilderness because they didn\\'t do the one thing that could save their life . . . \\nthinking . \" \\ndespite the predictability of the main plot , a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise , and made me smile when i realized that everything isn\\'t as it seems anymore . \\ni have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise , so instead i will avoid it entirely . \\nthe first two-thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along , and some of charles\\' survival techniques seem possible , even making fire from ice . \\ntamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear , but whenever the bear is present , the characters lose all sensibility . \\ni have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water . \\nwhy not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ? \\ni guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while . \\nthankfully , we already have begun to care for the characters , and so we let this small detail slide . \\nbut some of the technical details are awkward , such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make ( where did they get thread and needles ? ) . \\nthe acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature , and borders on phenomenal . \\nanthony hopkins gives a terrific performance , creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day . \\nhopkins usually brings greatness to his roles , but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences\\' sympathy , something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs . \\nalec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) . \\nbaldwin can be a good or a bad character , and here he succeeds at both in a way . \\nyou can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end , and baldwin is able to handle the double-natured photographer . \\nelle macpherson gives a good performance , albeit slight . \\nshe isn\\'t in the film all that much , but for the scenes she does have , she handles as an actress , not as a model . \\nharold perrineau is a good actor , and his scenes are nice and underplayed . \\nhe is eliminated early , and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable . \\nthe edge is rated r for graphic violence , some gore , and language . \\nsome of the violence is a little too disturbing , even for me . \\nthis film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to , but too many cliches bog it down . \\ndirector tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts . \\ndavid mamet\\'s script , though , has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat , and the acting is solid . \\nthe best thing about the script is the ending which doesn\\'t end with the normal high-strung action sequence , but with a small detail involving a certain gift . \\nit\\'s a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear . \\nand by the way , most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear . \\nway to go , bart . \\n',\n",

and destroy it . \\nthen , we meet a farmer-wizard , dallben , and his young apprentice , taran . \\ntaran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a `pig-keeper\\' ( they have a pig named hen-wen ) . \\none day , as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath , the pig goes crazy , and dallben then realizes , after watching hen wen\\'s thoughts through a bucket of water , that taran must hide hen wen in the forest . \\nan evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron , and only hen wen has the power to show its location . \\ntaran leads hen wen into the forest , but of course , he loses her , and tries to go find her . \\nalong the way , he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi , who desires `munchings and crunchings\\' , much to his dismay ( besides , he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen ) . \\nwhen he hears hen wen\\'s squeal from far away , though , he races to her rescue ? only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants . \\ntaran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king\\'s castle from far away . \\ntaran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen . \\nhe manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon . \\nthere , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls . \\nalong the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie . \\nthe three manage to escape the horned king\\'s castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic . \\nas they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen\\'s trail . \\nhe leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of `pig tracks\\' , to a whirlpool . \\nsuddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy-like fairfolk . \\ntaran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva . \\nhe then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world . \\nwith the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage . \\nit turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place . \\nwhen taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ?

) . \\njust when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr . \\ntaran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not wanting him to throw his life away . \\ngurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay . \\ntaran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king . \\nhe kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely . \\ntaran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king\\'s castle just as it self-destructs . \\nthe witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they `never give anything away , they bargain\\' . \\nin response to this , the witches offer taran his sword back , but taran instead has a new trade : the cauldron for gurgi . \\nthe trade is made ; gurgi\\'s seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group . \\nas taran cradles him in his arms , though , gurgi stirs-he is not dead after all ! \\nthe happy group then returns home , where hen wen ( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past ) , dallben , and even doli , await their triumphant return . \\nas spectacular as it sounds , the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times . \\nbefore ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions , he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron , a sword and sorcery tale for the studio . \\nbringing this book to the screen was the studio\\'s fondest dream . \\nmiller , who entitled himself as the executive producer , promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects . \\nwhen micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio , the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron . \\nby this time , things had gone really rocky for the animation department . \\nmany of the studio\\'s old men had retired or died . \\ntherefore , the animators suffered a hard time making this film . \\noriginally budgeted at $25 million , the costs raised to $40 million because of constant changes on everything ? and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped . \\nthe film was rated pg and the film , although `disneyfied\\' from lloyd alexander\\'s chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney\\'s other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it . \\nin addition , other critics rejected it for having `no heart\\' and `unmemorable\\' , compared to other disney animated features . \\nbut whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $21 million . \\nthe failure of the film grounded the studio\\'s animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio\\'s reputation . \\nthe next two disney animated features , the great mouse detective and oliver and company , although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron , didn\\'t do much better ( although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective ) . \\nonly with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features . \\nas for the black cauldron , it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron . \\nfinally , the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released . \\nbecause of all this , you might ask yourself , was the black cauldron really such a bad movie ? \\nthe people who had seen the film didn\\'t think so . \\nin fact , many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film , but of course , they denied it . \\nfor a while , it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video ? until september 1997 , disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom . \\nfew people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who hadn\\'t seen the film yet ( i am included here ) , they got quite a treat . \\nbut people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors , about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating ( in the uk , the u rating means universal : suitable for all ages , kinda like their own version of g ) . \\nsomewhere online , a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said , `bring back the black cauldron ! \\' , and because of that , disney finally decided to release the video to the united states . \\nbefore that time , rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed , like the uk video , so that it would get a g rating , and that they would add in songs . \\nthose rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron * would * be released in its pg rated version . \\neven still , when it was finally released to the us , some reaction was mixed . \\nsome felt that it was indeed cut , but some felt that it wasn\\'t . \\nbut these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable , since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available . \\nas for myself , when i saw the movie for the first time ( on converted ntsc video ) , i didn\\'t expect much at all . \\nin fact , i had heard so many mediocre things about it , that i didn\\'t think the film would ever be such a good film . \\nmuch to my surprise , when i saw the first few minutes of the film , i was asking myself , \" this is the same film everyone saw ? \\nthe one that flopped at the box office ? \\nthe one that critics and filmgoers alike called \" a bad movie \" ? \\nthis doesn\\'t seem like all of the above . \\ninstead , it\\'s a classic in its own right . \\nthe film has a wonderful cast of characters . \\nthere\\'s taran ( grant bardsley ) , an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig-keeper , the story\\'s hero . \\nthe critics have said that taran is not likeable at all , but the opposite is true . \\nhe is brave , loyal , and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on . \\nthere\\'s a likeable character here ! \\nnot that he\\'s the only likeable character in the film . \\nthere\\'s gurgi ( john biner ) , a lovable little , uh , thing who remains loyal to taran , even though they don\\'t quite hit it off at first . \\nbut another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman , a dwarf named creeper ( phil fondacairo ) , who is loyal to the film\\'s imaginative and sinister villain , the horned king ( voiced gruesomely by john hurt ) , yet he also fears his neck . \\nthe other characters , including the sidekicks , a spunky , but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm , and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret , although pleasant and likeable , aren\\'t quite as well rounded as they should be . \\nthe story itself is an adventurous one , a quest involving the mystical pig , hen wen , the black cauldron itself , and an army of deathless ones with everything : a hooking opening to a spectacular finale . \\nelmer bernstein\\'s music also tells the story perfectly , in a dark , yet calming manner . \\nthe animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios . \\neven though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good , like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth , the animation overall is top notch . \\noverall ? this film is an entertaining endeavor . \\nfans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one , except young kids . \\nthere are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney\\'s other films ( although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary ) , which is the main reason why this film is rated pg . \\nfans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie . \\neven though it doesn\\'t have all of the ingredients of a true disney film , this film is a classic in its own right , and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given . \\nthat better chance has finally come . \\nwhatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared , and the film has finally achieved its place among disney\\'s most proudest achievements . \\ni can\\'t help but think though , whatever would have happened if the black cauldron * was * a box office success ?

\\nor are there simply no rules in war ? \\nthe answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious , but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions . \\nthe murder of 83 \" innocent civilians \" has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u . s . where is the accusations from the arab leaders ? \\nwhere is the u . n . ? \\nthe film ends without even telling the most interesting story : what happens on the international arena ? \\nthis film ( in a way akin to films such as \" a few good men \" ) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism . \\nthese accusations are pretty heavy , but also unfair . \\nwhat director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking . \\none of the earliest apparent problems with \\'rules of engagement\\' is its lack of credibility . \\nthe entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now , but is overdone , contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed . \\na lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality . \\nthat is precisely why it\\'s not offensive . \\nit is completely unobjective . \\nmany stories are started and never finished . \\nmany questions are asked , but never answered . \\na lot of parallels are referring to nothing . \\nit seems that neither the director , producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film . \\nis it about arab mentality ? \\namerica\\'s foreign policies ? \\namerica\\'s role in the world ? \\ncorruption in the higher circles ? \\nit goes on and on . \\nit consists of countless stories , but not a definable plot . \\nit tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one . \\ni think that it is ironic , because director william friedkin\\'s probably most acclaimed film was \" the exorcist \" which had a silly story , but became a rather effective film . \\nin this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film . \\nthough several scenes bare the mark of professionalism ( such as the impressive battle scenes ) , his latest film does simply not engage . \\ni believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed . \\nit\\'s obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe . \\nthe characters feel designed , unreal , merely shadows , with no life outside the conflict . \\neven the actors can not save this film from going under . \\nthough both jackson and jones act admirably , with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this , it is not something that these great actors can boast of . \\nthey have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back . \\njackson is gray and jones uninteresting . \\nthe rest of the cast , including ben kingsly , blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks . \\nthe time has come for the verdict . \\non the charges of complete lack of objectivity , i find this film guilty . \\non the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking , i find it guilty . \\nbut on the charges of racism i find this film not guilty , because of it\\'s inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere , not only when concerning the arab population . \\ni must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bit too far , portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood bad-guys . \\nthis is very sad , since in a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth . \\nhowever , it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states . \\nand that it\\'s not a coincidence that u . s . residents in the middle east , including yemen are on constant maximum alert . \\n',\n",

       " b\"the question isn't why has grease been reissued . \\nthe answer to that one is easy : to celebrate the movie's 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramount's coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity . \\nno , the question that ought to be asked is : should grease be reissued ? \\nthe answer is not an easy one . \\ngrease is a fun movie , an entertaining fantasy of the '50s , embodying all the cliches of that era . \\nthe music is lively and the dance numbers , choreographed by patricia birch , are energetic and high-spirited . \\ntravolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon , cool , but non-threatening . \\nbut grease didn't break any new cinematic ground . \\nit was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider . \\nwhat grease is - or has become - is the highest-grossing musical in film history . \\nok , let's not be a spoilsport . \\ngrease is a fun and entertaining movie , even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta , olivia newton-john , taxi's jeff conaway and the multi-talented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers . \\nit's nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was , and it's sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career . \\nhe could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly . \\ncinematically , the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur . \\nbetween grease and 1996's evita . , you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand . \\ntwo reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre : the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated , no , make that cynical and jaded . \\ntoday , if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight , he or she would probably be hooted off the screen . \\ntoday's audiences lack the innocence , that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed . \\nsecondly , a lack of talent . \\nperformers with the charisma , the style , the larger-than-life panache of fred astaire , gene kelly , ginger rogers and judy garland are gone . \\nmost singers and dancers remain on the stage , and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts . \\na good example is gregory hines , one of the greatest dancers in the world . \\nhe danced a bit in the cotton club , tap and white nights , but those were essentially dramatic vehicles . \\nso , perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose . \\nif audiences show enough interest , meaning if the re-release earns the studio enough revenue , it may spark a revival in movie musicals . \\nperhaps not original musicals such as singin' in the rain , an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers , but for broadway properties that have been in the planning stages for film adaptations for several years . \\nat one time or another , according to the industry rumor mill , hollywood has been set to create an animated version of andrew lloyd webber's cats , a filming of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables and chicago , the latter reportedly to star madonna . \\nso , let this grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals . \\nlet grease be the word that sparks this revival . \\n\",\n",

so instead , she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar , bilal ( said taghmaoui ) . \\nhe becomes her lover , taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls . \\nthe girls readily accept him , and there is no big-to-do made about their openly sexual relationship , but the girls really don't know what to make of the relationship . \\nit especially bothers bea , who is embarrassed by her mother's loose attitude and wants to go home . \\nthings go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village . \\nit seems only that bilal's charm is matched by his shiftlessness , as he has a wife who still lives there . \\nthis scene didn't make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also . \\nbut i doubt that . \\nthe family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next , as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel . \\nlucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel , while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a 'normal' girl . \\nthe beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets . \\nkate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner , living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences , as many a drop-out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose . \\nthe background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film . \\nthe only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn , a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves . \\nthe family's travel , which is on the edge , has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting ; but , when she gets up , all there is , is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her . \\nthat marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her , is starting to wear thin in her thoughts . \\nit will dawn on her , when bea takes ill , as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her , whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence . \\nhe is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him . \\nthe new guru is grounded in reality , something she is not grounded in , and seems to tell her what she couldn't comprehend from anyone else , even comforting her , by telling her that her tears are memories- a gift from god . \\nthe film's weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia . \\nthe storyline about a helpless single parent , detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby-boom generation had during their trip to morocco , who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism , a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers , contrary to the impression the film might give , seemed to pass her by . \\nher knowledge of that trip is only surface deep , at best . \\nshe perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn't have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey . \\nafter all , the mystical trip is the journey . \\nthe film's strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings . \\nbilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity . \\nthe little girls are precocious but they are lovable . \\njulia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but doesn't know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them . \\nshe was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london , she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she's at . \\nthis is a very freudian way to look at things , as this sudden realization , that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey , at least , for the time being . \\nand , after all is said and done , who's to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences , just like she probably was ! \\n\",\n",

he would have gotten away with it if it wasn\\'t for those annoying little kids . \\n \" the kids \" in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable . \\nthe lawyers who help release carter also are underused , as is clancy brown as a kind prison guard ( the complete opposite of his character in \" shawshank redemption \" ) . \\nthere is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears . \\nhedaya was superb in \" clueless , \" same for david paymer in \" get shorty , \" harris yulin in \" ghostbusters \" and liev schreiber in \" the daytrippers . \" \\nit is a mystery how this many actors signed on to such shallow roles . \\non the other hand , it is absolutely no mystery why denzel washington agreed to play rubin \" hurricane \" carter . \\nthis role is about as far off from shallow as you can get . \\n',\n",

a tear rolls down washington\\'s cheek--and will probably run down your cheek as well . \\nthe episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn\\'t deserting the army at all ; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores . \\nfreeman is , as usual , a strong presence , even in a small supporting role . \\nhe plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember . \\nhe quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers , holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers . \\ncolonel shaw recognizes freeman\\'s leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major , making him the first black officer in the army . \\nandre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles , a free black who is one of shaw\\'s close childhood friends . \\nsearles is educated and refined , like a white man , prompting washington to nickname him \" snow flake . \" \\nthe burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat . \\nthe road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment . \\nthe soldiers suffer innumerable hardships , but somehow they never lose their morale . \\nthe army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens , subjecting them to racism and discrimination . \\nthey are paid only $10 a month , whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen , and , for a long time , they have to go without shoes , guns , or uniforms . \\nto make matters worse , the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action , preferring instead to use them for manual labor . \\neventually , however , the regiment receives its boots , uniforms , rifles , and right to fight , thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw . \\nshaw has absolute faith in his soldiers , and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve , even if it means threatening a general with blackmail . \\nbroderick , in fact , is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment . \\nunfortunately , however , broderick\\'s uneven performance is , in many respects , the weak link in the movie . \\nin an effort to look more mature , broderick sports a mustache and a goatee , and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent . \\nhe is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced . \\nthe film places too much weight on broderick\\'s character and not enough on the black soldiers , who are more intriguing . \\nglory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war . \\nthe movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july . \\nglory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts . \\nexcept for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head , the film , for the most part , leaves the gore to your imagination , which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid . \\nto the contrary , they are chaotic and horrifying ; it\\'s just that director edward zwick ( the co-creator of \" thirtysomething \" ) films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster . \\nthe key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers . \\nthe movie depicts some of ( but not enough of ) their customs and rituals . \\nin one scene , for example , the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire . \\neach man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration . \\na couple of the movie\\'s most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe , disbelief and pride . \\nthe regiment\\'s greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle , thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner . \\nlike any war film , glory has its share of gloom and despair , but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson , a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say ( or , more precisely , what they do not say ) , blacks played a critically important role in the north\\'s victory over the south--forever changing the evolution of america . \\n',\n",

       " b\"seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented ) . \\none of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise . \\nwith some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie . \\nthere's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there . \\nthe goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict . \\nthe premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist . \\nwe begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely . \\nlater he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right . \\nthe fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling . \\nthis opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone . \\nthe man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him . \\nin fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we've observed them for a while . \\nbut in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story . \\neventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police . \\nwe met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time . \\ntwo other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies . \\nit was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film . \\nhe also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story . \\nbut absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo . \\neverything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities . \\nhowever , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential . \\nby continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax . \\neveryone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction . \\nbut , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off . ' \\nfor reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' ) . \\nthe aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight . \\nat the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then . \\nthis premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard . \\nhe does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form . \\nthe aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see who will change and who will not . \\nin the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world . \\nhowever , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is . \\nthe main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either ) . \\nfor example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending . \\nand that's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense . \\nironically , this is what made his first film `the crow' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world . \\nwith `dark city' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message . \\nstill , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable . \\nthere's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does . \\nthe story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years . \\n`dark city' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world . \\n\",\n",

       " b'remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage ? \\n \" pulp fiction \" and \" fargo \" both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture , and not surprisingly , a slew of rip-offs followed in the years thereafter . \\nthat fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing \" the way of the gun \" that at first glance looks like another of those wanna-be\\'s but upon closer inspection doesn\\'t look like anything comprehendable . \\nit\\'s a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere - a film that won\\'t allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous . \\ncomplexity should come as no surprise to anyone who\\'s familiar with mcquarrie , he wrote \" the usual suspects , \" which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim . \\nthat film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate , confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings . \\nyou have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that \" if it\\'s really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating . \" \\nwith \" the way of the gun \" mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea , but this time the story is far less commercial - a shame because maybe that would have helped . \\nthe film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but aren\\'t hell-bent on death either ( played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro ) . \\nthey get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big-shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization . \\nthey figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother ( played by juliette lewis ) and get a nice ransom . \\nalong the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec , his wife , their hired goons and the \" bag man \" ( played by james caan - the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he\\'s doing ) . \\nthe exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously can\\'t call the authorities for help . \\nhis goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers\\' trail and each make different offers to get the mother back . \\nthe exec\\'s son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right . \\nmeanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double-crosses , secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all . \\nmcquarrie doesn\\'t know the meaning of the word simple . \\nhe seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie . \\neverything has to be complicated and confusing , so much so that it\\'s to the point of surrealism . \\nnothing is what it seems in this reality , it\\'s one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry\\'s rules and regulations . \\nevery scene with caan\\'s character exemplifies this perfectly - the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him , getting into conversations about \" the business \" and how it works and we\\'re hardly given a clue as to what they\\'re talking about . \\nthese characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they\\'re more like ideas ripped-off from sketches found in david mamet\\'s trash . \\nno one here really acts like a real person , and the story is even further removed from reality . \\nit\\'s like a dream without any appeal . \\ntake the opening scene for example ; the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff . \\nthey sit on a brand-new mercedes and the car alarm goes off , the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they don\\'t move . \\nthe guy and his loud-mouth , potty-mouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them . \\nyou\\'d think phillipe ? and del toro are ? going to pull out guns and scare them away but they don\\'t , instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob . \\nthere\\'s a lot of things i didn\\'t understand about this scene : first of all the owner of the mercedes isn\\'t some yuppie or old rich snob , he\\'s like a hippie straight out of the 60s . \\nsecondly , the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed . \\nlastly , it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small country\\'s army . \\nif they were suicidal they wouldn\\'t have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place ( and where they get all those guns is never explained either ) . \\nthere\\'s a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility . \\nwhat it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems - which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is . \\nabsolutely none of the characters are likable or believable . \\nand it\\'s all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flat-out black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time . \\nwith any film you see , whether you like it or not , you can at least understand what the appeal was to it , why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it . \\ni can\\'t say either for \" the way of the gun , \" because it has very little going for it and i can\\'t imagine anyone intelligently defending it . \\n',\n",

\\nas far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn\\'t developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements . \\ncharacter relationships in this film also make very little sense . \\nfor some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex . \\nwe get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes . \\nbassett and spader\\'s characters start off hating each other . \\nfifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they\\'re engaging in some hanky-panky . \\nwhen troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him . \\nevery single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut . \\nthe most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits ! \\nfurthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits . \\nmaybe that\\'s why the film\\'s title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster . \\nright after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you\\'re seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations . \\nthe rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b . point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby . \\npoint b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing . \\ndoesn\\'t make sense . \\nsince i didn\\'t understand anything about these characters\\' motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ? \\nnot a whit . \\nit\\'s a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do . \\nthey don\\'t find it . \\nbassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces . \\nsexual tension ? \\nmore like constipation . \\nmaybe they\\'re just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as \" this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice . \" \\nnot that we ever find out who that is , mind you . \\nthe climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film\\'s biggest forehead-slapper . \\nas troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected . \\nhe\\' s awfully one-note , but it\\'s not as if he\\'s given any more notes to work with . \\nthe rest of the cast does even less . \\ntunney stands around looking cute , then scared . \\nphillips broods . \\ncruz flirts with the computer . \\nthen they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn\\'t paying much attention by then . \\n \" supernova \" is pretty awful , but i\\'m cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got . \\nthat\\'s it . \\nif you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you\\'ll probably hate it more than i will . \\neven the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven\\' t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn\\'t going to save the film . \\nhonestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ?

       " b\"books could be , and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy , and rightfully so . \\nthis is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late 70s/early 80s , inspiring literally dozens of clones , from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day , and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre . \\nthe special effects were groundbreaking , revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later . \\nliterally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it . \\nand now , george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy . \\nmuch has been and is still being made of the fact that mr . lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now . \\nsome fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection , while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday's star wars updated with today's special effects wizardry . \\neither way , the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen , where it rightfully deserves to be seen . \\ncan there be anyone in the world who doesn't know what star wars is about ? \\nin a way , star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it . \\nit's a story about a young man's coming of age , a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire , a tale of swashbuckling and derring-do the likes of which haven't been seen on the silver screen in decades , strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn , and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world . \\nit's high adventure , incredible special effects , and . . . well , it's just an _experience_ . \\nsomething about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation . . . and \\nit's about to do so again . \\nthis new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film's devoted fans , who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now . \\ninterviews , trailers , leaks from within lucasfilm . . . all of these have been collected , collated , and placed on webpages for people to see ( pages such as http : //www . islandnet . com/~corona/films/details/sw4 . html \\nor , my personal favorite , http : //leopard . cs . latrobe . edu . au/~koukoula/ \\n ) . \\npictures of before and after have been placed side by side . . . even \\nmonths before the movies were released , fans were making comparisons . \\nin some cases , the changes were nothing less than phenomenal , and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater . \\nthe digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here , unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original . \\nfor instance , in my personal favorite example , the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep , moss-covered carvings and etchings . \\nand mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling , booming city , with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing . \\nall the starships and fighters are now computer-animated , getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally made--and they look _fantastic_ . \\nfour and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added , including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in 1977 simply couldn't do it justice . \\nhowever , much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself . \\nthe negatives , badly damaged by the ravages of time , were brightened and returned to their original splendor . \\nthe audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed , with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt , into glorious , booming , theater-shaking full-thx dolby digital stereo . \\nand _that_ , more than the added scenes or new special effects , is where the real value of this new version lies . \\nit's really true what they say in the commercials : star wars loses _so much_ on the small screen . \\neven letterboxing doesn't make up for the decrease in size and definition . \\nin regard to the star wars special edition , and to the other two films of the trilogy which have yet to be released , i'll make this final recommendation : go and see it . \\ngo and see it more than once . . . it \\nmay be another twenty years before it comes back to the big screen after it's gone this time . \\ntake along the youngsters who've never had the big-screen star wars experience--you'll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time . \\nthere's magic in this movie--special edition or no , there can be no denying that it's still star wars , and still has the power to thrill and enthrall children of all ages , from four to four hundred . \\nlet's all return to that time long ago , and that galaxy far , far away . . . \\n\",\n",
       " b'the uncompromising nudity bared throughout petrice chereau\\'s intimacy has already garnered much notoriety , but it\\'s in the naked faces of fearless actors mark rylance ( angels & insects ) and kerry fox ( welcome to sarajevo ) that the tender ache of emotional resonance is discovered . \\nwith sharp , intelligent eyes that reflect experience and maturity , rylance and fox are refreshingly detached from the false glamour of hollywood idols . \\ntheir sex scenes together are bracing in their raw honesty , in the acceptance of flesh and messiness . \\nless apparent , but no less remarkable , are the astute observations of behavior revealed through those carnal beats of haste and hesitance , often without a single line of dialogue . \\nnot aiming for the spiritual poetry of in the realm of the senses or the philosophical transgressions of crash , chereau keeps his sexual odyssey firmly grounded in terms of straightforward character development . \\nthat may be the very reason why intimacy seems unerringly impressive but never particularly significant on more than a tactile , sensory level . \\nthe themes of human isolation are barren and obvious , a science project devoid of any especially groundbreaking hypothesis . \\nintimacy does manage to stand out from lesser portraits of \" human interconnectedness \" and pinter-esque rummages through psychological dirty drawers ( okay , kill me ) . \\nshallow though it might sound , it\\'s amazing how much is filled in through an inspired cast , perceptive camerawork , and imaginative ways of treating the love scene . \\nthose ingredients are too assured and confident to merely dismiss as icing on the cake , especially since they are the substance of the cake itself . \\nadapted from a pair of short stories by british novelist hanif kureishi , intimacy weaves desperate lovemaking between two strangers in london . \\nevery wednesday , jay ( rylance ) and claire ( fox ) meet in his cluttered , dank apartment for an hour or two of sexual release from their uninspired lives . \\nhe\\'s been head bartender at a posh restaurant for over six years . \\nshe\\'s a mystery to him but her glum workaday appearance reveals a similar dissatisfaction . \\nthey\\'re both married , but his relationship has curdled into an embittered separation . \\nas the weeks draw on , jay obsessively takes it upon himself to uncover claire\\'s personal routines . \\nin his attempt to gain a fuller semblance of who she is , he opens wounds that hadn\\'t existed before by single-handedly corrupting the fantasy . \\nif it weren\\'t for a few unnecessary subplots involving jay\\'s brother and his bevy of disgruntled co-workers , this minimalist premise might be described as a modern fable on the perils of wish fulfillment . \\nchareau\\'s restless camera ( once again wielded by superb and ever-attentive cinematographer eric gautier ) is less appropriate here than in his family transit-oriented those who love me can take the train . \\nthe scenes that linger are the still ones where rylance and fox separately , pensively attempt to carry on with their makeshift household routines . \\nthese are often captured in lingering , unblinking wide shots that view them stranded amidst their drab workplaces and homes . \\nseparation proves haunting in a melancholy series of intercut shots as rylance and fox undress on opposite sides of the room , crawling across the floor to meet in the center . \\ndespite being as restless as a fly during the hyperactive restaurant scenes ( all the better to blend in with a hustling crowd of gabby trendsetters ) , you\\'d be hard pressed to find a single uninteresting image . \\nintimacy takes an interest in its sordid world of the lower-middle class , with lonely pubs and busy shopping streets -- it also understands the people who inhabit those spaces , viewing them with sympathy scraped raw . \\nan evaluation would be incomplete without highlighting the great timothy spall ( the robust scene-stealer of many a mike leigh collaboration ) . \\nas claire\\'s cuckolded husband , this jocular heavyweight plays out his handful of bitter pill scenes with the unforced menace and self-effacing embarrassment of his imposing bulk . \\nbangs in his eyes , his mouth forming into quizzical pouts and dry smirks , he may seem the fool in his barroom encounters opposite a sarcastic , gleaming mark rylance ( whose jay has arrived on the scene looking to stir up some trouble ) , but spall is no one to trifle with . \\nhis overreaching best pal demeanor suggests a mind abuzz with secret passageways of guile , his pointed questions only na ? ve if you choose not to read into their crafty insinuations . \\nin his unassuming way , spall\\'s carefully etched interpretation of hostility buried under a mountain of surface propriety may become one of the most criminally underappreciated performances of the year , but maybe also one of the best . \\nhe\\'s that good . \\n',\n",
       " b'let me begin by saying that this is easily the worst movie in the entire official ( and even unofficial ) james bond series . \\nit is so full of self-parody and silly characters that you would almost believe you were watching a spoof . \\nan omen of what is to come is provided by the pre-credits sequence , a dull affair featuring a confrontation between a man ( it\\'s difficult to give a better description since no mention of him is made elsewhere in the movie ) and the assassin of the title . \\na song with woefully terrible lyrics follows , and the rest of the movie is even worse . \\nthe plot might have been a pleasant change from the usual rule-the-world so often found in the james bond movies of the 70s , but here we get a confused mismash about a fabled assassin , francisco scaramanga ( christopher lee , putting in a performance which is one of the rare saving graces of this movie ) who someone has apparently payed one million dollars to in order to remove roger moore\\'s 007 . \\nthere is also a flimsy connection with the energy crisis and a missing solar cell with 95% efficiency . \\nit\\'s as much of a mess as it sounds . \\nbond is \" helped \" in his task by mary goodnight ( ekland ) , whose character couldn\\'t possibly be any closer to the stereotypical bimbo . \\nduring the course of the movie she gets locked in both a closet and a car trunk , blunders around a control room accidentally setting off a laser and serves no purpose in enhancing the plot whatsoever . \\nmaud adams ( later to star in octopussy ) is a much more stronger and useful character , but she hardly features in the movie . \\nscaramanga\\'s lackey is a dwarf called nik-nak , who rather fittingly is also possibly the silliest henchman in the series , serving up annoyance and weak dialogue in equal measures . \\nworse still is an almost total lack of action throughout the whole movie . \\nthere is but one fight sequence about fifteen minutes in ( not counting a ludicrous scene where two teenage girls beat up several dozen trained martial artists -- another misguided attempt at humour ) . \\nthe solitary car chase might have been a highlight , but the \" action \" is interrupted on a frequent basis by a redneck sheriff ( j . w . \\npepper , played by clifton james of live and let die \" fame \" ) yelling stupid comments out of the passenger window . \\nhe is easily the most irritating character in a james bond movie . \\neven his presence could have been made bearable by one of the most impressive car stunts in cinematic history , a 360 degree twisting loop jump over a broken bridge -- could have been , except somebody got the idea to dub a mocking whistle tone over the final print . \\non top of that debacle , the whole end of the film is an anticlimatic sequence in scaramanga\\'s \" funhouse \" . \\nthe only good thing that came out of this movie was that the producers had to make the next film in the series ( the infinitely superior \" the spy who loved me \" ) a great film in order for the bond franchise to survive . \\n',\n",

       " b'whether or not i would be considered a trekker probably depends on whom you would ask . \\ni have been a fan of both the original series and its recently retired follow-up , as well as the even- numbered entries in the film series . \\nhowever , i have never been one of those folks who store away trek minutiae and get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs . data . \\nsomewhere along the line , the \" star trek \" film series began to seem more and more directed at those in the latter category , and star trek : generations may be the natural conclusion of this direction . \\nits production values may be high , but the writing is frequently appalling , and instead of a script has a collection of references , in-jokes and ill-defined characters . \\ngenerations opens in the late 23rd century , where members of the original enterprise crew , including captain james t . kirk ( william shatner ) , are present for the christening of the latest ship to bear that name . \\nno sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than a distress signal brings them to the nexus , a mysterious ribbon of energy . \\namong those rescued from the nexus is long-lived alien dr . soran ( malcolm mcdowell ) , but he is none-too-pleased at being back in the real world . \\nseventy-eight years later , soran is still trying to get back to the nexus , and again encounters an enterprise , this one led by captain jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) . \\nsoran\\'s plan involves destroying a star with an inhabited planet , and the only hope for saving 230 million people is the historic meeting of two enterprise captains . \\ni don\\'t think it is an insult to fans of \" star trek \" to suggest that to a certain extent , the particulars of a plot are not really the most important elements in a \" trek \" film . \\nit\\'s about a chance to visit with old friends , and if they are involved in a truly interesting story it can be considered gravy . \\nbut even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be consistent , and in generations that just doesn\\'t happen . \\ndata ( brent spiner ) is particularly victimized by this sloppy writing . \\nin the film\\'s major sub-plot , data decides to use a chip which will give him human emotions , a chip he has had in his possession for over a year . \\nwhat is his motivation for taking this drastic and perhaps dangerous step ? \\nhe doesn\\'t get a joke . \\nonce the chip is in place , spiner gets to have a lot of fun with data\\'s new emotions , but the point is that he\\'s no longer the data we know . \\nif the rest of the \" next generation \" cast fares any better , it\\'s only because they\\'re on the screen so little that they\\'re simply window dressing . \\nbut then again , this story isn\\'t really about the new crew . \\nit\\'s about kirk and picard , the cowboy and the politician , sharing the screen . \\nthe huge surprise is that william shatner blows patrick stewart away . \\nperhaps because he knows this is his last go-round in the part that made him a legend , shatner looks like he\\'s having the time of his life ; stewart , on the other hand , borders on the deferrential , and is saddled with the same lackluster motivations as everyone else in the cast . \\nstewart\\'s edginess is indicative of what may be a very bad sign for paramount\\'s hopes to turn the new cast into the same kind of franchise the original cast was : these are clearly the not ready for big screen players . \\nby contrast , the prologue which features scotty ( james doohan ) and chekhov ( walter koenig ) is the highlight of the film . \\nthese characters have become part of the popular mythology , and when they take over the enterprise in a moment of distress , it\\'s a moment of high energy . \\nonly thirty years of history can create a moment like that , and that\\'s time this new crew doesn\\'t have . \\nit certainly doesn\\'t help that the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your way out again . \\nit\\'s also loaded with little gags all aimed at those who are familiar enough with the series to turn to all their friends in a shared nudge of recognition . \\ni wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold to the \" trek \" universe at this point would be anything but baffled and bored by what is going on . \\nand what a waste of malcolm mcdowell , who could have been a great monomanical villain but should have been given a much more compelling reason for his obsession . \\nthere are plenty of details both scientific and of continuity to pick at , but to do so would be to ignore generations\\' major flaws . \\nhowever , i would like to make one recommendation : seatbelts . \\nnot just for the enterprise crew , although you\\'d think by the 24th century space travel wouldn\\'t involve rolling around on the floor during a battle . \\nno , i think the audience might need them more . \\nthis journey is one bumpy ride . \\n',\n",

\\nwell , maybe children . \\nokay , so you might say that this is a movie for children . \\nit\\'s not . \\nin the scenes where good fights evil , there\\'s a lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if they\\'re watching a cartoon . \\nso is the film for adults ?

\" \\na guest asks impatiently . \\n \" forty million , \" groeteschele responds wryly . \\nthe problem with groeteschele\\'s mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war . \\nthe only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals . \\ngroeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over . \\nyet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o\\'herlihy ) has often recommended . \\non the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u . s . , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage . \\nsuch a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race . \\n \" fail-safe \" clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film . \\nwhy continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ? \\nis it wise ? \\nis it even logical ? \\nno , not really . \\nalthough \" fail-safe \" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way . \\nagain , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film\\'s most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance . \\nin addition to providing the central \" pro-nuclear war \" voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism . \\nthe context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib . \\none of groeteschele\\'s \" logical \" trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it\\'s merely absurd . \\nhe labels the average marxist an \" unfeeling , calculating machine \" that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself . \\ngroeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russia\\'s home soil--which must be preserved at all costs . \\ngroeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would . \\nthe irony here is groeteschele\\'s own mechanical theorizing . \\nhe is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn\\'t even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns . \\nonce the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be . \\njust how will the soviet union\\'s leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ? \\n ( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? ) \\nwith the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) , the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader , in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity , with lumet\\'s long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader . \\nwithout getting into too much detail , i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly , yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances . \\n ( that is , as sensible as a nuclear \" incident \" can probably be . ) \\nit does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all-out war , something that simply isn\\'t possible because of its all-too-real consequences . \\ndramatically , the ending is quite powerful , and the use of o\\'herlihy\\'s character as the symbolic \" matador \" ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film\\'s opening ) , is particularly appropriate . \\n \" fail-safe \" is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) , and it has the structure of a high-tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film . \\nnevertheless , under lumet\\'s direction and walter bernstein\\'s intelligent adaptation of burdick\\'s and wheeler\\'s novel , the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded . \\nthe film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming . \\nbut it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that \" fail-safe \" also finds dangerous . \\nin retrospect , the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century . \\nit\\'s just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down , rather than continuing groeteschele\\'s dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown . \\n',\n",
       " b'ok , i admit it--i find camp amusement with the spice girls . \\nyes , the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual \" identities , \" they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of \" girl power . \" \\nbut not even their guilty pleasure appeal isn\\'t enough to carry their big screen debut , a junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world . \\nthe film begins amusingly enough , with a cheeky 007-esque title sequence in which the british quintet-- \" scary \" ( melanie brown ) , \" baby \" ( emma bunton ) , \" sporty \" ( melanie chisolm ) , \" ginger \" ( geri halliwell ) , and \" posh \" ( victoria adams ) --are introduced one by one ( to , much to my surprise , excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience ) as they croon the silky ballad \" too much \" ( a tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film ) . \\na few minutes and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the film : ( 1 ) the spicy ones go on a european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at london\\'s royal albert hall ; ( 2 ) a film producer ( george wendt ) and a screenwriter ( mark mckinney ) pitch various film ideas to the girls\\' manager , clifford ( richard e . grant ) ; ( 3 ) a documentary film crew follows the girls ; ( 4 ) a pregnant \" mate \" ( naoki mori ) of the group rapidly approaches her due date ; and ( 5 ) a tabloid publisher ( barry humphries ) attempts to destroy the group with the help of a sneaky shutterbug ( richard o\\'brien ) . \\ncapped off by a live rendition of the girls\\' bouncy hit \" say you\\'ll be there , \" a wealth of laughs and merriment is sure to follow , right ? \\nwrong . it\\'s all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches . \\ni must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves , but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them , much less a organized framework for all the \" wacky \" goings-on . \\nspice world jumps from vignette to vignette , subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense , at one minute having the girls meet with aliens ( no joke ) and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride . \\nwhile a decent joke slips through the cracks here and there--during a \" dance bootcamp \" scene , the girls sing the lyric \" we know how we got this far/strength and courage and a wonderbra \" --much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level . \\nsome gags are just plain pointless , such as roger moore\\'s recurring role as the mysterious chief , who dispenses cryptic , metaphor-heavy advice to clifford . \\nthe only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond . \\nha ha . \\nas weak as the script is , i think there\\'s one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie , and that is the girls themselves . \\nthe point is not that they can\\'t act ( and , for the record , they really _can\\'t_ ) but that their individual personas , which works as a gimmick over the span of a four-minute music video , are too thin to survive outside of the truncated , video bite mtv world . \\nposh ( who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions ) comes off best by default because her persona ( rich bitch ) most easily translates into character in a film . \\nbaby\\'s persona ( young innocent ) , to a lesser extent , also works , but the remaining girls\\' identities are a little harder to flesh out . \\nthere really isn\\'t much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often ( which is _exactly_ what fuller and spiers do ) , and , after all , what exactly entails being \" ginger \" or \" scary \" ? \\napparently , just their wardrobes . \\nspice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices\\' signature hit , \" wannabe . \" \\nthe song is as grating as ever , but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a much-needed shot in the arm , setting the stage for a wave of self-referential humor stemmed from the screenwriters\\' film ideas ( the film almost mirrors robert altman\\'s the player in the way the film snails into itself ) . \\nthis section of the film , involving all manner of derring-do involving a speeding bus , is perhaps its most effective , but it also points up how all the other storylines ( the publisher , the documentary crew ) lack a satisfactory payoff . \\nspice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family , and it will please the spice faithful . \\nbut this sloppy enterprise surely won\\'t win them any new fans , which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states . \\nonce the hype disappears , spice world will likely serve as the the spices\\' final hurrah in america . \\n',\n",

       " b'bruce willis and sixth sense director m . night shyamalan re-team to tell the story of david dunne ( willis ) , a stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child . \\non a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job , dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of . \\nto make things even stranger , dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed . \\na comic book art dealer named elijah price ( samuel l . jackson ) , who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly , has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life . \\nprice felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him . . . \\nsomeone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break . \\nprice contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child . \\ndunne doesn\\'t believe him at first , but price assists him in discovering his \" powers \" and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is . \\nwriter/director m . night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense . \\nhow exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years ? \\nfor shyamalan , the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners . \\ndoes this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash , though ? \\nthe answer to that question is not a very easy one , either . \\nas far as pacing goes , the sixth sense seemed almost interminable . \\nit wasn\\'t until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally ( and perfectly ) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re-connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached . \\nfor unbreakable , shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which , in many ways , blows away the film that had come before . \\nthe story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan\\'s direction is excellent , with the camera almost constantly moving . \\nthere are tons of great shots in the film , not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis\\' character and another train passenger . \\nthe shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak . \\nalso very impressive is the film\\'s score by james newton howard ( who also scored shyamalan\\'s sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes , as well as this year\\'s dinosaur ) . \\nseveral of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film . \\none of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to \" exercise \" his powers . \\nthe music , in combination with the stellar visuals , really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie . \\nif there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year , this one would be it . \\nthe film also boasts some great performances , including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment . \\nwillis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne , who just can\\'t seem to figure out why he\\'s been depressed for the last few years . \\nhis character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him , but he eventually grows into his own under elijah\\'s tutelage . \\njackson is one of the better actors of our time , and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah . \\nthough his hairstyle is absurd , jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked . \\nrobin wright penn\\'s role seems slightly underwritten , but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character\\'s need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again . \\nspencer treat clark , as the dunne\\'s young son jeremy , shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors , and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film . \\nout of all the characters , jeremy\\'s is perhaps the most emotional , and clark does a great job with the role . \\nwhere the film does lose points though , is during its \" surprise \" ending . \\nshyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense , but i found myself saying \" that was it ? ! \" \\nwhen unbreakable revealed its own ending . \\nit\\'s not that the ending is bad , it\\'s just that the ending doesn\\'t quite have the emotional punch that the other film\\'s did . \\nplus , it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels ( and i won\\'t reveal the ending here , but you\\'ll understand what i mean when you see it ) . \\nessentially , what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable . \\nthe only real problem is that the ending doesn\\'t quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor . \\nas long as it isn\\'t held to the standard that sixth sense set ( which it ultimately will be ) , it should be a remarkably well liked film . \\none thing seems clear , though . \\nshyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film . \\n',\n",

murray\\'s a stitch , especially when pulling up beside the van ryan limo after winning lombardo\\'s case and flipping them off . \\nand don\\'t leave when the closing credits hit the screen , or you\\'ll miss the film\\'s best part -- four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns , plus a final scene that caps everything off with a great stunner of a bombshell . \\nspeaking of bombshells , denise richards , who plays almost every scene in a blue bikini top , does the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she was never allowed to flaunt in \" starship troopers . \" \\nmatt dillon flexes his sleepy-voiced sex appeal , and pulls off personality changes with chameleonic precision . \\nneve campbell , lovely as ever except when sporting a blond wig , gives suzie a vengeful vulnerability that makes her the most interesting member of the conspiring trio . \\nre-edited and toned down a bit , the dynamics between these three actors could have carried the film to greater lengths . \\nbut what we\\'re given works well enough . \\n \" wild things \" is highly entertaining and , indeed , very wild . \\n',\n",
       " b'do film critics have morals ? \\nare there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow ? \\nnaturally we don\\'t want to go into a film with any preconceived notions , which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish . \\nsecondly , and along the same line , we can\\'t prejudge a film because of it\\'s stars , director , etc . the difference ? \\nwell , in the first one , we\\'d go into a film thinking it\\'s going to be dumb or it\\'s going to be good , and that would affect our viewing ( that movie sounds and looks dumb , so i\\'m not expecting much ) . \\non the second hand , we\\'re simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal \" grudge \" against the film company ( it\\'s made by disney ? \\noh , it\\'s just a merchandising ploy then ) , the actors ( jim carrey\\'s in it ? \\nit\\'s gonna stink ! ) , or the director ( who ? \\ncan\\'t be that good ) . \\nthis is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint . \\nmake sense ? \\nok , but what about comparing ? \\nisn\\'t that kind of along the same lines ? \\nwhen we compare a certain actor or director or even composer\\'s credibility in one film to another they were involved in , is that really fair ? \\nsure , in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more , but what about jackie brown , for example ? \\nis it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction , just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both ? \\ni think it is , and i\\'ll tell you why . \\na good critic should be able to view the film from the \" average joe ( or jane ) \" viewpoint , while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film . \\nsometimes that can be tough . \\n \" the acting was superb , but i was bored \" or \" i loved it ! ! \\nit was sooooo cheezy ! \" \\nmight be used to describe a film . \\nthese are contradictions , and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique . \\nbut which is more important ? \\nand which is better ? \\nan extremely well shot and acted film that is boring , or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again ? \\ngetting back to the point , my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we\\'re reflecting what the public wants to know anyway . \\nevery average person out there who\\'s interested in this film is likely to ask \" how does it compare to pulp fiction ? \" \\nand so , as a critic , i\\'m already responsible to ask that same question . \\njackie brown stars pam grier , the \" blaxploitation \" heroine from the 1970\\'s , who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character . \\ntarantino\\'s pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta\\'s sudden revival in the movie industry , and with talks of an oscar nomination , the same is likely to happen for grier . \\n ( we\\'ve made it thru comparison #1 ! ) jackie is a 44-year-old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash , and probably her main revenue , by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie ( pulp fiction\\'s samuel l . jackson and comparison #2 ) . \\nordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara ( robert de niro ) , a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years , to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half- million dollars . \\ntrouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics , as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed . \\nnaturally this proves an obstacle to ordell\\'s plans and , not as friendly intended as we\\'d hope , he posts jackie\\'s bail after she is put behind bars . \\nthe thing is , ordell is in this for no one more than himself , and as we learn from his previous actions , he\\'s willing to kill anyone who stands in the way . \\njackie finds herself in a tight squeeze . \\nordell won\\'t think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she\\'s always done , yet at the same time , a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided . \\nit comes down to a simple question : would jackie rather face ordell or prison ? \\nwhat ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help : the law , ordell , or maybe just herself . \\ncoming into play is another 70\\'s veteran , robert forster as jackie\\'s bail bondsmen max cherry . \\nmax\\'s obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system , and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance . \\nalso involved is ordell\\'s \" surfer girl \" girlfriend melanie ( bridget fonda ) , a ditzy sun- bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand . \\nfonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role , but there\\'s nothing more to her , and therefore , she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters . \\nde niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself . \\nde niro is a brilliant actor , but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn\\'t need a de niro to play him . \\ncompared to pulp fiction ( comparison #3 ) , the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable . \\nin pulp fiction , even the small , seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful , complete , and lifelike , whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn\\'t have suffered much with a lesser talented cast , the exception being grier . \\ntarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind , so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth . \\nsadly , grier too could have received a bit more attention , especially when the story is all about her newly-jarred perception of life . \\njackson teams up with tarantino again , but the chemical reaction isn\\'t as awesome as the first time . \\njules was the rambling , bible-quoting hitman in pulp fiction , and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off . \\nand although jackson is really , really good in jackie brown , i don\\'t think he\\'s quite as irreplaceable . \\nin fact , maybe a new face would have been better . \\njackson could\\'ve remained tarantino\\'s jules , and a new guy could have become ordell , forever to remain so in our memories . \\nsadly , these characters are too much the same , except ordell just isn\\'t as impressive , and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules . \\nanother problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning . \\nthis is grier\\'s film , so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses ? \\nit not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted , but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story . \\nit is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino\\'s quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style , and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard\\'s novel \" rum punch \" . \\nfor those movie-goers , don\\'t expect another pulp fiction and you\\'ll be satisfied , for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90\\'s film- making . \\nthe directing has toned down a bit , however , yet we\\'re still reminded that this is tarantino\\'s movie thanks to odd split-screen story-telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints . \\nso getting back to the question that i began with , this isn\\'t pulp fiction at all . \\nit\\'s good , but it isn\\'t anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place . \\nthis is a more conservative tarantino , but not one that won\\'t satiate true fans . \\nif you can realize that this isn\\'t going to knock your socks off , then you\\'ll be happy to at least let it massage your feet . \\nafter all , we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy . \\n',\n",

       " b'some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese\\'s raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the \\'80s . \\nsince there are still a number of \\'80s films that i haven\\'t seen , i don\\'t feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i\\'ll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level . \\nbio-pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry , dull textbook account . \\nit\\'s rare that a movie with the moniker \" based on the life of ? \" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining . \\nraging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre . \\nthe picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the \\'40s and \\'50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen . \\nfor all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying . \\nhistorically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion\\'s share of the details culled from la motta\\'s own autobiography ( which was co-written with joseph carter and peter savage ) . \\nhowever , although la motta is credited as the movie\\'s \" consultant , \" he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout . \\nthe la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base , bestial impulses ? paranoia , jealousy , and blind rage . \\nsex and violence are inextricably linked . \\nthe title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull . \\nin the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them . \\noutside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled . \\nthe two people who spar with him on life\\'s canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother/manager , joey ( joe pesci ) . \\nthese are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses . \\nhe beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence . \\nraging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up-and-coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class . \\nover the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch-rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match . \\nmeanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15-year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife . \\nvicki becomes jake\\'s greatest prize ( a wife , in his view , is not a companion , but a possession ) and the source of his most extreme pain . \\nhis own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him . \\nhence , he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else ? perhaps even his brother . \\n ( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : \" are you f * * king my wife ? ? ? \" ) \\nin the late \\'40s , la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight , but with one huge condition : he must take a fall . \\nhe does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing . \\ntwo years later , he wins the championship , only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray . \\nby the late \\'50s and early \\'60s , when the film ends , jake has become a pathetic figure ? a broke , overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor , has lost his wife and children , and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine . \\nraging bull is the other side of rocky . \\nsylvester stallone\\'s tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976 . \\nit won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production . \\nbut , where rocky romanticizes boxing , raging bull takes a cold , unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring . \\nwhile scorsese\\'s primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man , he never backs away from showing the seedy , ugly underside of a sport where gambling , greed , and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working . \\nrocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased . \\nthere\\'s little i can say here that hasn\\'t already said about de niro\\'s performance . \\nin a career that has included many fine roles , this is his most outstanding . \\nthe level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering . \\nand , although there\\'s a lot of travis bickle ( de niro\\'s character in taxi driver ) in la motta , scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that , if we never fully sympathize with him , at least we understand the forces that drive him . \\nthis is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting . \\nas the younger jake , de niro is trim and fit . \\nas the fat , older man , de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form . \\nhow many actors would go that far ? \\nthe best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance . \\ncathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work ( although neither won ) . \\ntheir portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro\\'s . \\npesci , who has basically re-created the same personality in two other scorsese films ( goodfellas and casino ) , presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother . \\nthe misogyny and violence are still there , only better concealed . \\nbut , when joey snaps , as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster ( frank vincent ) , it\\'s startling to behold . \\nmoriarty , on the other hand , must play the temptress with virginal qualities ? the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake . \\nlater , she\\'s called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear . \\nscorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black-and-white ( a few \" home movie \" segments are in color ) . \\nthe choice is perfect for the movie , giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a black-and-white approach is almost unheard of . \\n ( one important recent exception , schindler\\'s list , eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did . ) \\nin black-and-white ( especially considering scorsese\\'s choice of shots and use of slow motion ) , the violence is stark and disturbing . \\nthere\\'s no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas . \\nduring fight sequences , the director also uses a number of point-of-view shots designed to show the world , however briefly , from la motta\\'s perspective . \\nscorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta\\'s loss to sugar ray , where he surrendered his middleweight crown . \\nafter that , his career was all downhill . \\nyet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment , stretching more than a decade into la motta\\'s future . \\nthe reason is obvious : scorsese isn\\'t as interested in boxing as he is in the character . \\nfollowing his retirement , la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever , but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies . \\nwe see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self . \\nwho cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando\\'s speech from on the waterfront ? \\n ( \" i coulda been a contenda . \" ) \\nperhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the \\'80s . \\nand , if not , it\\'s certainly perilously close to the zenith . \\n',\n",
       " b\"well , what are you going to expect ? \\nit's a movie about a big snake that eats people . \\nthat's what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film , because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more . \\ninstead , i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me , too . \\nanaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river . \\nled by anthropologists dr . steven cale ( eric stolz ) and terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives . \\nalong the way , they find poacher paul sarone ( jon voight ) , and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda . \\nto simply say that this is the world's largest snake wouldn't be doing it justice , since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide . \\nif this isn't a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers , i don't know what is . \\nat the beginning of anaconda , we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past , but that seems to be more or less over now . \\ni expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line , but it ended up being a set-up for nothing . \\ncale chokes on a deadly wasp ( don't ask me how that happens - i don't know ) and is put out of action , relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help . \\nthis minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot , since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone's plan to capture the snake . \\nhowever , this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film , and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle . \\nmost bad characters are either annoying or stupid . \\nin this movie , they're both . \\nsince this description applies to all the characters except sarone , it's hard to find someone to root for . \\nyou're supposed to back the good guys , but you really end up cheering for sarone because he's smarter than everyone else . \\nor maybe he's just not as dumb as everyone else . \\nat times , i almost found myself rooting for the snake . \\nthere are no standout performances here . \\neveryone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters . \\neven voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason . \\nno matter , as in most monster movies , the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway . \\nin most of the scenes , the snake is computer generated , and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real . \\nhowever , the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences . \\nsometimes , for example , the snake just moves too fast . \\nit catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall , for crying out loud . \\nthen there's another scene where the snake eats one of the characters , and we see the snake's skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victim's pained expression from within the snake's belly . \\nabsolutely ridiculous . \\na testimony to the film's bad direction is the inclusion of a scene early on the in the film , where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is . \\nin a scene totally unrelated to anything else , we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther . \\nthe anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard , one of the panther's eyeballs pops out . \\neeeewwwww . \\nabove and beyond the sick factor , however , this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed . \\nin films like these , a sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained . \\nif the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see , we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them . \\nto show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don't know about , and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown . \\nin a case like that , the showdown just ends up being a letdown . \\nwhen i saw the snake for the first time , i decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake i saw wasn't the real danger . \\nthis one was just a decoy , and there was actually a bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe . \\nno such luck . \\nokay , maybe anaconda is actually a decoy , and there's really a better movie waiting to make its debut . \\n\",\n",

oscar is obsessed with theology . \\nlucinda is rich ; oscar is poor . \\nlucinda is forward and self-assured ; oscar is timid and uncertain of himself . \\nyet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals -- the compulsion to gamble , whether it\\'s on horses , dogs , cards , or the flip of a coin . \\nand fate has decreed that they will one day meet . \\nthat day doesn\\'t occur until 45 minutes into the film , when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney , australia , where he hopes to change his life and minister to anyone in need of his help . \\nanother of the passengers is lucinda , who is returning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newly-acquired glassworks factory . \\nat first , their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor , but it doesn\\'t take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other . \\na friendship is born , and , once they reach australia , it develops into something more potent . \\nbut oscar is uncertain of lucinda\\'s affection , and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her . \\noscar and lucinda isn\\'t beyond a little manipulation to get the desired emotional response , and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions . \\non more than one occasion , it\\'s apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route . \\ncoincidence is a crucial plot device ; without it , this movie can\\'t go anywhere . \\nthe voiceover narration ( never one of my favorite techniques ) is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments . \\n ( however , without it , the final twist , which i will not reveal , would not be as poignant . ) \\nyet , despite these quibbles , i enjoyed oscar and lucinda . \\nstoryline faults pale in the light of two such finely-realized characters . \\nthematically , the film is also strong . \\nthe unifying motif -- that everything in life is a gamble -- is successfully delineated . \\noscar and lucinda don\\'t just wager their money , they bet their hearts , minds , and souls . \\na card game they engage in shortly after they first meet could easily be considered a form of emotional \" strip poker \" where defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared , secret passion . \\noscar does not see gambling as a vice . \\nin fact , he believes that the greatest chance one takes in life is betting one\\'s immortal soul on the truth of a religious faith . \\nralph fiennes , who normally plays strong , confident men , is very much at home as the fumbling , insecure oscar . \\nthe actor brings a variety of nervous tics to the part , all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is on-screen . \\nas good as fiennes is , however , he is eclipsed by cate blanchett . \\nthe actress , who appeared earlier this year as one of the leads in bruce beresford\\'s paradise road , is mesmerizing as lucinda . \\nshe gives this liberated woman her flash , and feeds the chemistry between the two lead characters so that it sparkles rather than fizzles . \\neffective support is provided by ciaran hinds ( the male lead in jane austen\\'s persuasion ) as lucinda\\'s close friend , tom wilkinson ( the full monty ) as oscar\\'s mentor , and clive russell as a self-serving adventurer . \\nthere\\'s a real magic in the way armstrong develops the story , keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too long on any one moment or sequence . \\n ( in fact , i wish she had devoted a little more time to the luminous middle act , which has oscar and lucinda together . ) \\nwith the skill of a consummate storyteller , she weaves romance , friendship , passion , humor , and tragedy together into a complete package . \\nthe characters , with all of their human foibles and neuroses , are wonderfully developed by fiennes and blanchett . \\nso who cares if the storyline is a little ripe and unwieldy ? \\noscar and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer . \\n',\n",

\\npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it\\'s worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . \\nbut they\\'re * chickens * , so it\\'s funny to us . \\nanother thing that helps \" chicken run \" ( and most of park\\'s films ) succeed is the animators\\' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they\\'re cribbing . \\nthere are references to \" the great escape , \" obviously , and \" stalag 17 . \" \\nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both \" raiders of the lost ark \" and \" indiana jones and the temple of doom . \" \\nthere\\'s even a nod to \" the blues brothers , \" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson\\'s nationality and film history . \\nthe \" braveheart \" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \\nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , \" chicken run \" is downright brilliant in its execution . \\nconsider this : since july of last year , i\\'ve seen dozens upon dozens of \" blair witch project \" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \\nout of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \\nwhy ? \\nbecause once you got past the thought that \" they\\'re parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch\\' movie , \" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \\nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \\nconversely , \" chicken run \" doesn\\'t lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \\nif you\\'ve never seen \" indiana jones , \" the chase sequence is still fun . \\neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \\npark , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it\\'s understood , and as a result , \" chicken run \" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . \\nenjoyment of this movie doesn\\'t require knowledge of film history , but if you\\'ve got it , \" chicken run \" is that much richer . \\nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it\\'s hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \\nginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on \" absolutely fabulous \" ) nails it . \\nshe has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . \\nthe characters\\' inevitable romance doesn\\'t feel contrived , but sweet . \\npoor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn\\'t any help . \\njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . \\nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that\\'s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \\none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of \" chicken run , \" it comes as a delightful surprise . \\nthe film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . \\nthe animation is first-rate . \\nremember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable \" chicken run \" really is . \\nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios\\' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . \\nas in such top-notch family fare as \" a bug\\'s life \" or \" toy story 2 , \" \" chicken run \" has something to offer in nearly every frame . \\ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they\\'ll catch all the details . \\nanyway , the movie\\'s just a boatload of fun . \\nfunnest damn movie i\\'ve seen all year . \\n',\n",
       " b'jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation . \\neven though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited , the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation . \\nthis is , after all , the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction . \\nto say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood , since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio , desperado , four rooms , and from dusk \\'til dawn . \\nhe was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide . \\n ( i\\'m willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him . ) \\ntarantino contributed on and off screen to these films , but never took the director\\'s helm . \\nnearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more , tarantino returns with a film he can call his own . \\nthe film opens up with an homage to the graduate , with jackie brown ( pam grier ) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her . \\njackie is a flight attendant for air cabo , which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas . \\nthis makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi ( samuel l . jackson ) who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico . \\nhowever , while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u . s . for ordell , jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus ( michael bowen ) and atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , who catch her not only with the money , but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs . \\njackie didn\\'t know they were in the package with the cash , but that\\'s of no consequence to the authorities , who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted . \\nof course , dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish , ordell . \\nordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) to get jackie out of jail , but while max is immediately attracted to her , jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety , since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police . \\nsure enough , ordell shows up at jackie\\'s apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good , but she \" borrows \" max\\'s pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell . \\ninstead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistol\\'s chamber to ordell\\'s head , jackie proposes a deal . \\nsince ordell wants to get his money out of mexico , jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more , but this time for a more substantial fee : fifteen percent of ordell\\'s half million dollars . \\nwith a gun in his face , how can ordell not agree ? \\nby itself , this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film . \\nhowever , we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think . \\njackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell , but she\\'s also making a deal with the feds as well as with max . \\nthe film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham , but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around . \\ninstead , it\\'s actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today\\'s movies . \\nat least this film has a little imagination . \\nmost of the performances in jackie brown are above par . \\npam grier , of whom i had never taken notice before , plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable . \\nsamuel l . jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control . \\nrobert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy , trying to do his best . . \\nnever mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guy\\'s apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course . \\nhe\\'s just so down-to-earth , the nature of his job really doesn\\'t occur to us , even when we\\'re shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison , or when we see the tools of his trade . \\nin supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara , a recently paroled friend of ordell\\'s , and bridget fonda as melanie , one of the girls ordell keeps around town . \\nunfortunately , de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between , and then they are mostly clipped sentences . \\nin this film , he\\'s not really de niro , but stereotypical de niro , uttering things like , \" little bit , \" and \" pretty much . \" \\nfonda , on the other hand , plays the slightly spaced-out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness , such that even when she is annoying louis , we are taking her side . \\nas is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand , the dialog is quick and snappy . \\nit grabs our attention and is actually interesting , and in many respects , this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals ; the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves . \\ndon\\'t count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera , however . \\nthere\\'s a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange , and he\\'s not really sure what\\'s happening , but by composing the scene just so , his realization of what\\'s going on is felt simultaneously by the audience . \\nwe look at the screen and think , \" gee , that\\'s clever , \" and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on . \\nalthough tarantino isn\\'t afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect , it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film . \\nthere are shots where a character is simply driving , and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head . \\nthis is a tribute to both direction and acting . \\nhowever , there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall , and she is looking for something ; desperately looking for something . \\nwe get the idea of the frantic nature of her search , but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she\\'s looking for , but instead hoping she\\'ll just stop . \\noverall , viewing jackie brown is time spent well . \\nsome flap has already been made about the language used in the film , but it\\'s really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today . \\nin fact , one might even be able to say that the way in which these \" offensive \" words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness . \\ngo see the film and see what i mean . \\n',\n",
       " b'robert altman\\'s cookie\\'s fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good . \\nit is a sunny , delightful , dreamy comedy , filled with lovely performances , skillful direction and topped off with an understated , clever , extraordinary script . \\nas this is an ensemble piece , it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters , all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs . \\nfirst we meet willie ( charles s . dutton ) , an honest man with a slight drinking habit . \\nwe then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie , who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness , despair , and want of her dead husband . \\nwe cut to camille ( glenn close ) who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora ( julianne moore ) . \\nthen we briefly get acquainted with emma ( liv tyler ) , an apparent relative of cookie , who is a down-but-not-out teen outcast , still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live . \\nwe also fleetingly see emma\\'s lover jason ( chris o\\'donnell ) , an ambitious but far too excitable young cop . \\nwe are now about one quarter through the two hour picture , and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion . \\nwe see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband . \\nshe exclaims \" here i come ! \" \\nand then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself . \\nsoon after , her niece camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl , comes upstairs , finds cookie dead and flips out . \\nconvinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family , she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow ( yet sweet ) sister that it was a murder . \\nshe makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well ; scattering jewelry all over the floor , breaking a few cabinets , windows and doors , and then throwing the gun out in the back yard . \\nthe only reasonable suspect is willie , who immediately gets taken into custody , and put in a jail cell ( they all know he didn\\'t do it , so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma ) . \\nmeanwhile , the unperturbed camille continues her none-too-subtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play a success . \\nso begins cookie\\'s fortune , a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as \" a southern spin on fargo , \" except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers\\' darker , somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade . \\nrobert altman\\'s slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well , in that both films focus ( on and off ) on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town . \\nindeed , most of the characters in cookie\\'s fortune are loads of fun to observe , and a portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi- dimensional . \\nglenn close turns in an insubstantial ( in terms of her career ) but magnificent performance as the conniving camille and is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie , and she is perfectly cast as the prolific \" aunt alexandria \" character , endlessly obsessed with family dignity . \\nthe equally essential role of willie is handled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s . dutton ( mimic , a time to kill ) \\nthere is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside hours , even days after the film ends . \\ncookie\\'s fortune is such a movie . \\ni loved the light , kindhearted approach altman ( whose last project was the dark , intense drama the gingerbread man ) took towards the tricky subject matter . \\ni enjoyed the talented ensemble cast . \\ni even liked the trite \" in the south everybody is related to everybody \" cliche that is inevitably employed by the time this movie draws to a close . \\ni\\'m not sure why cookie\\'s fortune had such an all-around pleasing effect on me . \\nperhaps it\\'s that good ol\\' southern charm . \\n',\n",
       " b'when i first heard about scream in 1996 , i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies . \\nfrom the master of the horror himself , wes craven , it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them , by making the teenagers do what they know they\\'re not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them ( don\\'t run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door , never say \" i\\'ll be right back , \" etc . ) . \\nwhen i first heard this description , i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie . \\nhow hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies . \\nwas this wes craven\\'s remedy from making \" real \" bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn ? \\nit just seemed cheap to me . \\nthen i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes , involving drew barrymore and a nail-bitingly intense phone conversation , completely changed my attitude . \\nscream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick , it\\'s also a pretty scary movie . \\nif you\\'ve seen a million of these kinds of films , you know exactly what is going to happen . \\nthis is part of the fun of watching scream . \\nthe movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent , attractive teenagers . \\nto those who rarely see these types of movies , scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film . \\nthere\\'s nothing wrong with that misjudgment though . \\ni have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience , the newbies to horror and the fanatics . \\ntheir opinions on the film were so different but both very positive . \\nfrom these varied reviews , i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories . \\nfilms that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed , in my opinion , if it was not for the outstanding success of scream . \\nthe low - budget 1996 gem may , alongside pulp fiction , be the most influential film of the 1990\\'s . \\nthis influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs . tingle or television programs such as dawson\\'s creek but to others such as myself , we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors , screenwriters , and directors . \\nscream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quickly-paced script by kevin williamson . \\nwithin the film are characters who tell other characters , as well as the audience , the basic rules and cliches of a horror movie . \\nmainly from the rants of randy ( jamie kennedy ) and stu ( matthew lillard ) , we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well ( the virgin always survives ; have sex and you\\'re dead meat ) . \\nnot only are we treated these rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films and actors . \\nthe script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own self-satisfaction . \\nin this case , williamson finds these errors for the audience\\'s satisfaction and amusement . \\ni hear there is a new movie coming out called scary movie which is a spoof of scream , which is a spoof of scary movies . \\ni will certainly see the film but i have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than scream\\'s perfect subtlety . \\nhowever my last gut feeling about this stuff , scream , was dead wrong . . . \\nso who knows . \\n',\n",
       " b'despite its exceedingly well-done visual effects , 1995\\'s original species was one big hunk of sci-fi cheese , from the writing to the feeble performances . \\nso , coming from such b-grade roots , its sequel\\'s stunning ineptitude is not terribly surprising , yet at the same time it is . \\nit would not have been difficult at all for the people behind species ii to top the hokey original , yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad , if not even worse . \\nsomething is clearly amiss when the back door left open for a sequel in species--a sewer rat becomes not quite of this earth after eating a body part from the exploded alien/human hybrid sil--is never entered into ( perhaps that was left for species iii--though i\\'m not giving away anything when i say that this installment has an open back door of its own ) . \\nthe alien fun and games begin this time when a three-person astronaut crew returning from mars inadvertently carries within their soil samples deadly alien dna that eventually infects the mission captain , patrick ross ( justin lazard , late of cbs\\'s short-lived soap of a few years back , central park west/cpw ) . \\nthis alien dna is not identical to that which created the original film\\'s sil , but it\\'s close enough , and upon arrival on earth patrick is mating like crazy , engaging in bloody sex with just about every woman he can find . \\nmeanwhile , scientist dr . laura baker ( the returning marg helgenberger ) has created a clone of sil named eve ( natasha henstridge again ) for research purposes . \\nit doesn\\'t take long for eve to sense another alien presence , which send her libido into hyperdrive . \\nit\\'s up to laura and her former partner , bounty hunter press lennox ( michael madsen , another returnee ) ; and patrick\\'s uninfected shipmate dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) to find patrick before the in-heat eve does . \\n \" this isn\\'t the x-files , goddammit ! \" \\nexclaims one character in the early going . \\nin terms of quality , he\\'s absolutely right , but he\\'s also wrong . \\nthe new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes patrick\\'s pupils to dilate once he\\'s infected . \\nlooks and sounds an awful lot like the x-files\\'s \" black cancer \" to me . \\nbut that\\'s not the only source director peter medak and writer chris brancato steal from . \\nspecies was already a ripoff of alien , but medak makes the cribbing much more blatant than the original\\'s director , roger donaldson , did . \\nhuman patrick is given a tongue that also has a tongue within itself , and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eve\\'s alien body ( which ironically was designed by alien designer h . r . giger ) . \\na large alien hive that our heros douse with a substance fired from large guns ? \\naliens sans flamethrowers . \\nthe visual effects were by far the best thing about species , and the sequel\\'s effects crew at steve johnson\\'s xfx inc . keeps that high-quality tradition alive ; no cheap-looking lost in space cgi here . \\nafter the effects , the original\\'s best asset was the fresh presence of henstridge . \\nhowever , medak and brancato have no idea what exactly to do with her for this installment . \\nat one point she\\'s called on to play alien \" empath \" ? la forest whitaker in the original , but for most of the duration she\\'s holed up in a glass cell . \\nby the time the big breakout so prominently featured in the trailer actually takes place , the film is well into its home stretch . \\nso the rest of the time we are treated to patrick , played with little zest by lazard . \\none problem with the first film was that the deadly , horny , but innocent-at-heart sil was too sympathetic ; no such problem with patrick , who comes off as a cocky pretty boy before the alien takes control . \\nthe rest of the cast also fails to add much , but the writing can be faulted for that . \\nhelgenberger and madsen go through the motions , but they are already hampered by the clich ? d development that somewhere between the two films , the once-linked laura and press stopped getting along . \\nwilliamson suffers the worst indignity . \\nhe tries his best to enliven the token african-american role , but how can anyone recite insulting , derivative lines such as \" i\\'m gonna get african on someone\\'s ass \" and not appear ridiculous ? \\nbut species ii\\'s worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting piece of work . \\nat least the original featured plenty to laugh at--unaccountably awful performances by the otherwise fine actors ben kingsley and whitaker , and the sight of helgenberger\\'s character performing fellatio on madsen\\'s , for a start . \\nbut the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all , let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach the camp level . \\nfor all the blood and gore , nudity , and sex thrown in , species ii is , quite simply , a vapid bore . \\n',\n",
       " b'people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies . \\noften science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller . \\nin such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked . \\nbut , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic . \\nsuch thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman . \\nthe mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits . \\nbut the right stuff film isn\\'t even fiction . \\nit was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program . \\nthe plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes . \\nthe major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier . \\nmany pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado . \\nbut one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records . \\nten years later , soviets have launched \" sputnik \" marking the beginning of the space age . \\nin order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space . \\nbest air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image . \\nin one of critics\\' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s . \\nsuch high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman\\'s film looks quite atypical for its time . \\nwith more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life . \\nbut the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker . \\nphilip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies . \\nthe right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking \" artsy \" projects . \\nthe right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film . \\nthe plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts . \\nthe film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece . \\nthat gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles . \\nsam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty . \\non the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases . \\nshepard\\'s performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn . \\nyoung dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward . \\nalways reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard . \\nkaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots\\' wives . \\nroyal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice-president lyndon b . johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch . \\ngreat acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman\\'s superb direction . \\nmost notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time . \\nthe beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline . \\neverything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world . \\nin that setting , it\\'s quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights . \\nbut the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and \" natural \" pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots . \\ntheir entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists ( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun , played by scott beach ) only to preserve their most basic human dignity . \\nthis contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , \" mercury \" astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space . \\nthose contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman\\'s superb use of poetic movie language . \\nediting is great , and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion ( the same image would be copied in many latter films ) . \\nalthough kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military , which provided authentic locations and period equipment , he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights . \\nthose effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space . \\nanother fine contribution of this film is \" oscar \" -awarded musical score by bill conti ; i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it . \\nit is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy . \\nsome of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period . \\nthis film is great , and its cult status is well deserved , but there are some minor flaws . \\nsome of the \" mercury \" astronauts aren\\'t fleshed out enough ( although being played by fine actors , like lance henriksen ) . \\nfilm also lacks proper closure . \\non the other hand , most logical conclusion of the film - landing on the moon - would require this film to be more than six hours long . \\nalso , some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians , who were portrayed as evil monsters , just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan\\'s america . \\nin some of contemporary interviews , kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible , and in order to do that , he portrayed russians not as they were in real life , but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s . \\ntime has passed ; now we don\\'t see astronauts as heroes . \\nin this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions , those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers . \\nfew young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up . \\nbut this film , sentimental reminder of the times \" when future began \" , perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow \" mercury \" astronauts\\' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky . \\nand even if they decide to stay on earth , they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema . \\n',\n",
       " b'contact is the 1997 movie i\\'ve seen the most - five times to be exact . \\nfour of those times were on the big screen , but even on a tv , it\\'s a very impressive film . \\nthe same can\\'t be said for films like independance day , but that\\'s because contact is a rare example in sci-fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects , and all of us know looking back that id4 didn\\'t offer much outside of some one-time delightful eye candy . \\ncontact\\'s wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) , a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of \" merely listening \" to sounds out in space . \\nher interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age , encouraged by her loving father , ted ( david morse ) , who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola , fl ( that was , of course , before the days of internet chat rooms ) . \\nwhile everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ( of which the program seti is an acronym for ) , ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on , keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive . \\nellie\\'s strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist , a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young . \\nin puerto rico , she meets palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a writer examining the effects of technology on the world\\'s overall happiness ; a one- time seminary student who describes himself as \" a man of the cloth , without the cloth \" . \\ndespite the vast differences in opinion regarding a \" supreme being \" , ellie and palmer hit it off , and even take the time to sleep together . \\nit\\'s a weak and hurried relationship , but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on . \\nmeanwhile , dr . david drumlin ( tom skerritt ) , who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money , is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding . \\nthis leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors , eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation , and only a one night stand to remember . \\nit is in this nm city where , several months later , ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space , perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science . \\nwhen the signal is closely examined , many new developments spring up , and before long , drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at . \\neventually , it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega ( where the signal seems to have originated ) . \\nthe media swarms , fanatics go further off the deep end , scientists clamor for new information , politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take , and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality ( remember when zemeckis couldn\\'t get enough of this in forrest gump ? ) . \\nas if that weren\\'t enough , ellie\\'s discovery leads her to the nation\\'s capital where she again runs into palmer . \\ncontact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs . religion . \\nthe impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented , with no signs of bias . \\narguments for both sides are intelligent , solid , and thought-provoking . \\nwhen palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega ( of which ellie is a leading candidate ) , personal convictions play a more important role than love interests . \\nthe question is , can a person who doesn\\'t believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90% of the planet * does * believe in a higher power ? \\neven when the film wraps up , it\\'s uncertain whether it\\'s meant to play as an advocate for religion , science , both , or even neither , and in our modern day society where \" right and wrong \" is only opinion ( at least speaking \" politically correctly \" ) , the ambiguity is an incentive . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong . \\nas much as it sounds like it , contact isn\\'t merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film . \\nit\\'s a * highly * enjoyable two and a half hours . \\ndespite its seemingly heavy issues , it\\'s not a tedious undertaking to watch this film . \\nthe special effects are outstanding , though ( warning ! ) \\nhighly depreciated on the small screen . \\neven so , some of the subtle visual effects ( that will likely go unnoticed by many ) are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as \" sci-fi \" . \\nthe storytelling is rich and complete , and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious ( and at times , even hokey ) , it\\'s easily one of the best 1997 films , and one of the best sci-fi films i\\'ve ever seen . \\nthis is zemeckis\\' best since back to the future , and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated , zemeckis now has real reason to boast . \\n',\n",
       " b'robin hood : men in tights is another mel-brooks-produced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein . \\nmel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life , his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit . \\nunfortunately , robin hood : men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles , none of the fun acting of young frankenstein , is devoid of the charm of spaceballs , and is even lacking the good , solid dialogue of history of the world . \\nit is , in short , one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks , or anybody else , produce . \\nthe plot borrows heavily from the well-received kevin costner movie of last year , robin hood : prince of thieves . \\nthis is not surprising in and of itself , and could have been used to great comic effect , mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie . \\nmel brooks does not take advantage of this , however , and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air , none of which connect and none of which are explained later on . \\nthe movie\\'s scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice . \\ncary elwes , of princess bride fame , plays robin of loxley , a man who was captured in the crusades , fighting with king richard . \\nhe escapes and , joining with a man named achoo ( i am sure you can see the obvious joke ) , fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard , which has been captured by evil prince john , played by funny comic richard lewis . \\nhe also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil \" sheriff of rottingham \" . \\na good adventure plot that is sadly unused . \\nelwes and lewis are both excellent comics , but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating . \\nneither actor has any good words to work with , and the lines simply aren\\'t funny , nor believable . \\nperhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone . \\nthis particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted , and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas , that i really felt like leaving the theatre . \\nmuch of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout , and some left the theatre . \\nchuckles were few and far between , and they mostly dealt with visual jokes ( such as an old , beaten up horse from \" rent-a-wreck \" ) then from any dialogue whatsoever . \\nscenes that could have been classics , such as the archery contest , are ruined by poor acting . \\nperhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive . \\nthe basic plot , that robin has received a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian , is not witty nor funny . \\nmel brooks as a circumcision-giving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience ( not all jewish , either ) . \\nthe movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails . \\nthe addition of a blind man who stumbles around , falling off cliffs , walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential , but is also made terribly offensive . \\nthe only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard . \\nhe is well worth waiting for , if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue , excruciating visual humor , old puns , ancient jokes and bad acting . \\nif you can\\'t , don\\'t even bother watching this miserable film . \\n',\n",

       " b'i am starting to write this review before going to see strawberry and chocolate , cuba\\'s oscar nominee for best foreign film , directed by tomas gutierrez alea ( who also directed the sometimes and in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo-- \" memories of underdevelopment \" . \\ni saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema class back in the late \\'70s ; it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition . \\ni knew then that memorias was probably a state-sanctioned political missive , and now expect strawberry will follow suit . \\nfellow internetters , primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to cuba ( soc . culture . cuba ) , have mentioned that strawberry is a harsh criticism of the revolution and its current state of affairs . \\ni have jumped to the conclusion that strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party line--it probably looks like political criticism , but it ain\\'t so . \\nhaving some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castro\\'s repressiveness , i can\\'t conceive of his tolerating honest and adversarial criticism of the revolution , and i can\\'t imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement . \\nas kids say these days , duh ! , the revolution\\'s current state needs no criticism ; its physical and spiritual crumbling is self evident . \\nthe proper questions to put relate to castro\\'s legitimacy . \\ni bet the film takes castro\\'s power for granted , and that this or any other movie , produced under cuba\\'s state control , cannot question his right to run cuba\\'s political show ( ongoing now for more than 36 years ) . \\nthat\\'s why i just can\\'t believe strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime . \\nlet\\'s see what happens after the room goes dark and the screen lights up . \\ni saw the film--twice . \\ni was right ; castro remained intact . \\nstrawberry negotiates the relationship between a young \" dialectic materialist , \" as he describes himself , and a homosexual photographer ( diego ) in 1979 cuba . \\nthe young man ( david ) is the son of peasants ; a symbol of the revolution\\'s reason for being . \\ngrateful to the revolution for the opportunity to receive a university education , he studies political science instead of literature , his avocation , because he perceives it is his duty . \\ntherein lies a likely unintended irony , since cuba has no need for political theoreticians . \\ncuba\\'s government is castro . \\ndiego\\'s lifestyle is the antithesis of revolutionary life . \\nhe enjoys the finer things--tea , opera , art . \\nhe does not do \" voluntary work \" for the revolution . \\nhis small apartment is a sensual oasis . \\nthe moniker \" bourgeois \" figuratively hangs over his head during the early parts of the movie . \\nhowever , he is a \" revolucionario \" in his own way . \\nthe supporting roles are filled by : an aging busybody with a heart of gold and a troubled psyche ; david\\'s roommate , who rally takes the communist party line to its expected extreme ; david\\'s ex-girlfriend , who dumped him for another guy , yet wants to bed him before she leaves for italy with her husband ; german , a gay sculptor whose work diego is attempting to exhibit , and who strikes a faustian pact with the government . \\ngutierrez alea and co-director juan carlos tabio do a fine job at almost showing that homosexuals can be revolutionaries too . \\nheck , towards the end of the film you begin to think the guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor . \\nhe really loves the revolution ( as supposedly does everybody else in cuba ) and wants to make it better by exposing and correcting some of its flaws . \\nreal criticism is missing though . \\nthis movie is political window dressing . \\nluis aguilar leon\\'s op . \\ned . \\npiece on fresa in the miami herald ( 10 march 1995 , at 21a ) did not color my judgment ; it presaged my intuition . \\naguilar leon expressed my sentiment about this film\\'s political angle best : like many artistic manifestations in cuba , strawberry and chocolate sprang from a totally manipulated environment . \\nas art critic ivan de la nuez well states in the latest issue of the magazine postmodern notes , the silenced artists are those who refuse to accept \" the charade in which artists can provoke up to a point , while the institutions legitimize themselves by forbidding them to go beyond that point . \" \\nalthough terrible propaganda , this is otherwise a fine film . \\n',\n",

       " b'in zoolander , the world\\'s most successful , influential and intellectually-challenged male model derek zoolander wonders , \" is there more to life than being really really really good looking ? \" \\nobviously , the film\\'s creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature-length movie out of his hilarious vh1/vogue fashion awards short-film subject : can there be more to this film than being really really really silly ? \\nno , of course not , and it never aspires to be anything more . \\nmuch like derek , zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie . \\nit\\'s not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy , and it never produces any gut-busting laughs ( except maybe a scene when derek\\'s model roommates all die in a tragic \" gasoline fight \" accident -- a riotously funny take-off of tommy hilfiger ads ) . \\nbut it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles , wild characters and performances , and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused . \\nbetter yet , this exaggerated version of the original three-minute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes -- just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag . \\nzoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs . \\nfashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu ( will ferrell ) drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed . \\nenter derek , whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel ( owen wilson ) takes the spotlight . \\non the trail of mugatu\\'s plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries ( stiller\\'s real-life wife christine taylor ) , and she\\'s hoping to use mugatu\\'s pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme . \\nmuch like the austin powers films , zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved , and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today . \\nwilson is hysterical as the young , vain hansel . \\nferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant , freakish mugatu in the same way dr . evil upstages everyone in austin powers . \\njerry stiller -- ben\\'s dad who\\'s best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld -- makes a priceless turn as derek\\'s slimy agent maury ballstein . \\neven ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged , large-assed masseuse . \\nas for ben stiller , it seems his derek has one gag : he\\'s stupid , which plays out in some uproarious one-liners . \\nunfortunately , taylor seems out of place and out of her league here . \\nmaybe it\\'s just because i can\\'t stop seeing her as marcia brady ( who she played in both brady movies ) , making her unbelievable as a dowdy , brainy plain jane who hasn\\'t had sex in two years . \\nshe leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo , who would\\'ve added real comic substance to the flimsy role . \\nwhile zoolander is hardly highbrow , its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times , especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days . \\nzoolander\\'s no masterpiece , but a very worthy distraction . \\n',\n",
       " b'it seemed like the perfect concept . \\nwhat better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? \\nit\\'s exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh . \\njim carrey\\'s signed on too ? \\neven better . \\nthe national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers\\' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as \" schizophrenia , \" and so forth . \\nsuch a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers\\' fire , proving that some people just couldn\\'t take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . \\nyes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn\\'t funny . \\nit\\'s not for lack of trying . \\nthe farrellys utilize in \" me , myself & irene \" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them . \\nthis , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . \\nsoon enough , charlie\\'s repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster . \\nthis guy isn\\'t above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he\\'s been insulted , or holding a little girl\\'s head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street . \\nthen things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks . \\nsome have suggested that this isn\\'t a problem , because the farrelly brothers\\' brand of humor doesn\\'t require plot to work . \\nthey\\'re wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys\\' last effort , 1996\\'s \" there\\'s something about mary . \" \\n ( 1999\\'s \" outside providence \" was technically an earlier project . ) \\nthe brothers\\' earlier film wasn\\'t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected . \\nin \" mary , \" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they\\'d have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion . \\n \" me , myself & irene , \" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at \" mary \" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work . \\nhaving been produced by the same guys who made \" mary , \" \" irene \" seems like an even bigger disappointment . \\nthe brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes . \\nbut they haven\\'t come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of \" me , myself & irene \" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy . \\nthe plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who\\'s in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that\\'s entirely predictable from the get-go . \\n ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? \\nyeah , me too . ) \\nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven\\'t already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . \\ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it\\'s no longer funny , merely gross . \\nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . \\ntake , for example , the subplot involving charlie\\'s three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . \\nthe incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . \\nbut by the end of the film , they\\'re still doing the same schitck it hasn\\'t been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn\\'t been dropped either . \\nthat\\'s too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . \\n \" me , myself & irene \" reeks of wasted opportunities . \\nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie\\'s new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank\\'s actions . \\nthis doesn\\'t really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie\\'s condition early on , so they don\\'t have any opportunity to be surprised by it . \\nthe film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , \" whitey \" ) , but the script doesn\\'t go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . \\njim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he\\'s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in \" all of me . \" \\nit\\'s a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . \\ncarrey doesn\\'t pull any stunts we don\\'t expect him to pull , and the farrellys\\' script doesn\\'t give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren\\'t set up in any meaningful way . \\nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . \\nzellweger\\'s irene is not a strong female lead mary in \" mary \" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . \\nirene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she\\'s ditzy , clever , or neither . \\nas such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only \" sane \" person in the film . \\nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . \\nhe , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . \\nafter viewing the shapeless mess that \" me , myself & irene \" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . \\nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . \\nbut i don\\'t believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . \\nif the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they\\'ll rebound just fine . \\neven after that happens , though , i\\'ll still consider \" me , myself & irene \" to be a high-caliber misfire . \\n',\n",

       " b' \" payback , \" brian helgeland\\'s inauspicious directing debut ( coincidentally , he previously penned the award-winning screenplay for 1997\\'s \" l . a . confidential \" ) , is a wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one idea---a movie with non-stop violence , death , and villains---and runs with it , or should i say , barely manages to crawl away with it . \\nmel gibson , in yet another disappointing picture ( \" conspiracy theory \" and \" lethal weapon 4 , \" anyone ? ) , stars as the reprehensible villain/hero , porter , a man who becomes determined to get his 50% share of $140 , 000 , which he stole in a robbery , back when his partner-in-crime ( gregg henry ) and drug-addicted wife ( deborah kara unger ) double-cross him , shoot him , and leave him for dead . \\nporter is not dead , however---not by a long shot---as he quickly rehabilitates and , along with his loyal prositute girlfriend , rosie ( maria bello ) , sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay . \\nthe tagline for \" payback \" is , \" get ready to root for the bad guy , \" and sure enough , this is true , as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way . \\ni wouldn\\'t have a problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest , but it wasn\\'t , and therefore , i found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into a wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever . \\nno attempt is made to flesh the roles into three-dimensional characters , and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them . \\njust because the protagonist , a \" bad guy , \" is played by mel gibson doesn\\'t mean i will \" root for him , \" and i didn\\'t . \\nquite the contrary , every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death ( although some of them did , anyway , just to spice up the dull proceedings ) . \\nsince none of the respectable actors in \" payback \" actually have human beings to play , only one performance managed to stand out . \\nlucy alexis liu ( of t . v . \\'s \" ally mcbeal \" ) , who plays a spicy s&m dominatrix , brightens up every scene she is in , and has a definite flair for comedy , something i would have liked to have seen more of , since most of the humor fell with a resounding splat . \\nmeanwhile , gibson , who is perfectly fine here , sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit challenging . \\nunger , who made an impression in 1997\\'s \" the game , \" is surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in , and only has two purproses : ( 1 ) to get high on heroin , and ( 2 ) because she plays a key part in an early flashback . \\nfinally , kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during the climax , and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb ( tellingly , he didn\\'t appear in the original cut of the film , but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later ) . \\nlike most action movies , the star often takes a licking but keeps on ticking . \\nin the course of the 102-minute running time of \" payback , \" porter is shot three times in the back , hit by a van , beaten up , and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer . \\nand guess what ? \\nnot only does he survive the whole ordeal , but he is happy-go-lucky in the penultimate sequence ( and can still walk ! ) , \\neven though he looks like he had recently substituted for a punching bag . \\n \" payback \" is not , in any way , an entertaining film , even though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes on , but take away that violence and what you are basically left with is a blank screen . \\nperhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this , so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements , like a fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for a few hours . \\n',\n",

a lot better than any film in the \" beverly hills cop \" series . \\nthat is because \" metro \" takes itself seriously , but doesn t prevent itself from having a little fun . \\neddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible , and controlled people . \\nthe \" beverly hills cop \" movies all featured eddie as a reckless , wild cop , always crossing the line by just an inch . \\nin \"

is established , and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda , a jewel thief , and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim . \\n \" metro \" takes different twists and slight turns , and there is one great , virtuoso chase scene , involving the a cable car . \\ncars flip . \\ncars crash . \\ncars turn over . \\nand it is done so

this : the ones that are part of the story , and the ones that are devices . \\nthe villain in \" metro \" is no more than a device , but he is a darn good villain nonetheless . \\nhe is played by michael wincott , whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp , as if he smokes a cigarette between every take . \\nwincott makes his villain , korda , as mean as could be , the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks , like richard widmark in \" kiss of death . \" \\nand , in addition , wincott s physical appearance and mannerisms , in the film , actually reminded my of an arrogant friend i use to have , who is no longer on my good list . \\ni liked \" metro , \" and i do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy . \\nhis past roles were the great ones but they were also a precursor to the maturing that would later take place , possibly from murphy s growing as a person , now having a family . \\n \" metro \" is a no-nonsense movie . \\nit works as a buddy movie , which it does not overplay . \\nit works as a dry comedy , which it does not overplay . \\nit works as a suspense film , which it does not overplay . \\nand it works as an action film , where it does have a tendency to occasionally go all-out . \\nbut who cares ? \\nit still remains serious , and it does not overdo itself . \\noh , and there were plenty of explosions in \" metro , \" as well . \\nhow nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those . \\nif there is one major objection i had to \" metro \" , it was the length , an area

       " b'i rented \" brokedown palace \" last night blind , having heard nothing about it beforehand , and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws . \\nfor anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety . \\nthat is no easy task . \\nsuperficially , it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies , notably \" return to paradise \" and \" midnight express . \" \\nas a result nearly every review of \" brokedown palace \" i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons . \\nthe consequence was nearly universal condemnation , which is a shame as this is a fine film . \\nfor those who have yet to view the movie , let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was \" midnight express \" ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of \" return to paradise . \" \\nin my view , if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad\\'s acclaimed novel , \" lord jim . \" \\nproblematically , the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set-up involving a suave con-man , a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world \" justice \" system . \\nthe girls are alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale ) . \\nthey\\'re life-long buddies who planned a high-school graduation trip to hawaii , and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents . \\nonce there , they find a $6 hotel and go sight-seeing , which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside . \\nthey get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room , a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them , but they are saved from hotel security by a charming , friendly australian , nick ( daniel lapaine ) , who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl\\'s scam . \\nhe then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves , first toward alice , then toward darlene . \\nby now alarm bells are going off among viewers . \\nthe ever-present nick is too slick and his stories don\\'t add up ( to us ) --the girls , of course , are too naive to notice . \\nlong before it happens , we\\'re anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast-talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting-ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag ( literally ) containing heroin . \\njust as predictably , the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison-bound for a long stretch . \\nleft unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice . \\nfor those in need of a ready answer , might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl\\'s fleabag hotel . \\nas one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed , the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer/fixer \" yankee hank \" ( bill pullam ) and his thai-born partner-wife . \\na recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film\\'s tag lines , \" who do you trust ? , \" and hank is no exception although seasoned movie- goers and those familiar with pullman\\'s oeuvre will find few surprises . \\nmuch of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short-hand fashion . \\nlou diamond phillips , for instance , plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who , while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank , withholds vital information at crucial moments . \\nis he part of a wider conspiracy ? \\nwith an inherently powerful , if somewhat tired premise , the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama , a prison story , and a potential character study of american teens , their relationship , and what constitutes friendship between them . \\nthe result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful , with the girls\\' interaction , hank\\'s investigation , and the various trials and hearings , offering hope for their release , delivering tension--as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape . \\nif \" brokedown palace \" has a major flaw , it is its creators\\' tendency , like time-constrained tourists , to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half-way down and return to the story\\'s main avenue . \\nand , if that were all there was to \" brokedown palace , \" it wouldn\\'t be a very good movie . \\nbut i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and , in this , they succeeded . \\nfor the main theme of the movie , like the proffered name of its location , is freedom--in all its permutations . \\nultimately , the other sub-themes may be considered window dressing . \\nyoung and pretty , alice ( danes ) is an old soul ; a wild , streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure . \\npresented as a perfect blend of yin and yang , dark and light , is her cautious best friend , darlene ( beckinsale ) . \\nclear-eyed and straightforward , alice is more complex than her friend . \\nshe comes from a poorer background , has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone ( including her own father ) . \\nwhereas darlene\\'s life is \" on-track , \" aimed at college , marriage , kids , a career , a suburban home , middle age and \" fulfillment , \" alice\\'s is uncertain , unfocused , and yearning . \\none poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors--friends and relatives from home , whose lives continue while hers is in limbo . \\ntellingly , alice is present but not included . \\njust as revealing of their different personalities , when alice and dar first come to thailand , the openness and delight on alice\\'s face doesn\\'t read as simple naivet ? ; the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat , reaching toward the sun , she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom , while \" dar \" remains seated in the shade . \\n \" brokedown palace \" begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank . \\nhowever unintentional , it\\'s all alice\\'s fault . \\nshe\\'s responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents , to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand , to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick . \\n ( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film\\'s beginning , darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison . ) \\ndar , of course , is the willing dupe which , in her view , confers innocence . \\nnever mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate . \\ndar is innocent . \\nit doesn\\'t matter . \\nalice is the subject of this movie . \\nshe and her journey toward personal freedom . \\nalong the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half-baked sensibilities and materialistic goals . \\nin the end , that culture , like its representatives , \" yankee \" hank and dar\\'s father ( a \" man who knows how to grease the wheels \" ) , proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl\\'s tragedy . \\nthailand\\'s culture , contrary to most opinion , comes off much better by comparison . \\nit amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes . \\ni believe the filmmaker\\'s view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior . \\nthe thai ( with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy ) were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles . \\nthe girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native-born . \\ntheir prison ( in stark contrast to the probable reality ) was no hellhole , being relatively clean and sunlit . \\nthe prison authorities demanded good hygiene , provided medical care when needed , and \" hard manual labor \" consisted of picking grass ! \\nthe thai guards were authoritarian ( what else ? ) but certainly not routinely sadistic . \\nas for the thai justice system , the reasoning of the thai judges , during both an appeal hearing and in the film\\'s penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality . \\n\\'freedom\\' has many faces and \" brokedown palace \" explores many of them . \\nin the extreme , we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit . \\nsome settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter . \\nbut freedom seldom comes without a price . \\nwhich is why the movie\\'s other tag lines are : \" what is your dream ? \" \\nand \" how far would you go ? \" \\ni believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom , incarcerated or not , by film\\'s end is alice . \\nshe finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility . \\ni think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact . \\nkate beckinsale\\'s character might more properly be likened to the \" released \" temple bird referred to twice during the film , \" trained to fly back to its cage . \" \\nas the thai magistrate observed in the film\\'s climactic scene , the issue was always one of \" character ; \" and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that \" freedom \" is achieved within oneself . \\nif one thinks back over the movie , which character was transformed by their experiences ? \\nincreasingly , the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of \\'kung fu woman\\'--female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures . \\nhere , at last , is the story of a modern heroine . \\nin reading the many user\\'s comments , i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon : whether or not a person liked the movie , almost everyone praised the actors . \\nthink about that . \\nwhen was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it , but raving about all the performances in it ? \\ndo yourself a favor : rent \" brokedown palace \" and watch it with a open mind . \\nthere\\'s more there than meets the eye . \\n',\n",

       " b'written by alex cox , tod davies , terry gilliam and tony grisoni \\ndirected by terry gilliam \\ni\\'ve always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid . \\ndropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded ; you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are , no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat , and no idea how long the ride will last . \\nthen there\\'s the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine-laced dose . \\nmushrooms , on the other hand , offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel : a steady , reassuring assent , a short period of thrilling motion and color , and then a smooth landing . \\nacid is for daredevils ; mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy . \\nmy point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas , director terry gilliam has made an acid movie , when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie . \\nfull of shocking sight gags , aggressive images and grotesque comic performances , the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s . thompson\\'s book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world-view from the inside out . \\nbut for those of us who just want to enjoy a well-made film , gilliam has produced a mixed bag . \\nfear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how self-professed \" gonzo \" journalist hunter s . thompson ( johnny depp ) and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta ( benicio del toro ) , came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorney\\'s convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971 . \\noperating under the pseudonyms of \" raoul duke \" and \" dr . \\ngonzo \" , the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender , then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite , cocaine , tequila and a rainbow of multi-colored uppers and downers . \\nthey terrorize every one they meet , mostly because every one they meet terrifies them . \\nduke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town , then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge . \\ndr . gonzo becomes enamored of a thick-bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane\\'s \" white rabbit \" reaches its climax . \\nand these guys don\\'t just trash hotel rooms - they rape them , humiliate them and leave them for dead . \\nthat neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence , depending on your point of view . \\nthompson\\'s book , besides being a hilarious read , has stood the test of time as an important historical document . \\nit simultaneously exposed the 60\\'s drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die . \\npontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompson\\'s message , but the truth is that , stripped to its bare essentials , what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy . \\nit\\'s a cheech and chong movie . \\nyou\\'re there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results : see johnny take drugs , see johnny fall down . \\nthere\\'s nothing wrong with this concept , but gilliam tries too hard . \\nthis is a frantic movie - all sweaty close-ups , wide-angle lenses , dutch tilts and other-worldly lighting schemes . \\nthere are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen . \\nbut to what end ? \\nmuch of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson\\'s book , and there are some priceless comic observations . \\nbut you\\'re hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work . \\nthis brings us to the performances , which strike me as all wrong . \\ndepp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c . scott in patton - a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson\\'s dialogue . \\nin between his several puking scenes , del toro fares better as dr . gonzo , but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost . \\nwatching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago , with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads - now that would have been something to see . \\nit\\'s interesting to note that alex cox , credited as a co-writer on the screenplay , was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over . \\nas much of a fan as i am of gilliam\\'s work , cox would have been the better choice . \\nsid and nancy , cox\\'s best work , covered essentially the same subject matter , but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film . \\ngilliam commits the compound sin of over-directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose . \\nwhat kind of movie was he trying to make , anyway ? \\nit doesn\\'t try to be a cautionary tale , and it doesn\\'t work as broad comedy . \\nif he had considered more carefully his purpose , the result would have been a much more interesting film . \\nbut i don\\'t want to be too hard on it . \\nthere are some truly funny moments , and if you\\'re in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it . \\ni do , however , recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance - i guarantee it will enhance the effect . \\n',\n",

       " b'the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola\\'s 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages . \\nmartin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime . \\nunfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola\\'s influence on mafia portrayals in the movies . \\nseventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime . \\nthis film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s . \\ngoodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) . \\nthe book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york . \\nat the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands . \\nafter couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) . \\nthree of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history . \\nwealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business . \\nbut the perfect world of \" wiseguys \" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy\\'s unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy\\'s reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry\\'s own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends . \\ngoodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory . \\nscorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker . \\nworld depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating . \\nscorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny . \\nafter being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens . \\nscorsese also manages to break viewer\\'s moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience . \\nwith the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character\\'s dialogue or narrator\\'s commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era . \\neven if we don\\'t pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker . \\nfirst , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie\\'s ironic prologue . \\nthen , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards . \\nthis multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation . \\nsame ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack . \\nnostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s . \\nbut the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed . \\nhowever , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people . \\nsuch scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s . \\nfragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn\\'t have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese . \\nhe uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious \" a day in life \" segment near the end of the film . \\nanother essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents . \\nthe most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues . \\njoe pesci deserved his \" oscar \" for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film . \\nray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn\\'t look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film . \\nliotta\\'s henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs . \\nliotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction . \\nlorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband . \\npaul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave . \\nas a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do -

       " b\"back in 1980s , chuck norris used to be synonym for the action films . \\nhe couldn't , of course , top the success and fame of big action names like sylvester stallone or arnold schwarzenegger , but sheer quantity of his films guaranteed that he was household name among shoot'em up and beat'em up genre aficionados . \\nthat quantity was mostly provided by cannon group , prolific production company that dominated the b-movie market in previous decade by flooding it with cheap , formulaic and , more often than not , unwatchable genre products . \\nthe hitman , 1991 action thriller directed by chuck's brother aaron , is one of the last among them . \\nchuck norris here plays seattle cop betrayed , shot and left for dead by his partner ( which shouldn't surprise anyone , considering the fact that the partner is being played by michael parks , specialised for roles of usually very mean characters ) . \\nsurviving the shooting , cop is pronounced dead and hired as deep undercover agent . \\nhe infiltrates the underworld circles in seattle and becomes their top hitman , using his abilities to start brutal war between three major crime organisations - italians , french canadians and iranians . \\nsince it is rather absurd to expect great acting ability from chuck norris , at least not in this kind of movie , the biggest attraction of this film should have been action . \\nwell , the action in this film falls flat - it is boring , repetitive and not at all exciting . \\nit is nothing more than monotonous series of scenes that contains violence too brutal even for this type of films . \\nwe know very little about norris' character while , on the other hand , gangsters are portrayed with more human dimension . \\nin the end we almost feel sorry for them , since they are shown totally powerless against norris and his unstoppable and bloody crusade . \\nduring the film , somebody obviously became aware of that problem , so the screenwriter introduced the subplot dealing with the black boy who gets adopted by norris . \\nthat caused another problem - any questions about nature of that relationship had to be quashed with another subplot - this one dealing with lady lawyer who sleeps with the hero and gets killed after fulfilling that screenplay obligation . \\nthe photography in this film is dark , setting is depressive and this forgettable piece of 1980s style cinema leaves viewers without any reason to justify the hour and half spent in watching it . \\n\",\n",

       " b'melvin van peebles\\' \" sweet sweetback\\'s baadasssss song \" was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement . \\nit was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident . \\nits violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before . \\nin style , content , and how it was conceived and produced , \" sweet sweetback \" was a cinematic revolution , whether or not one agrees with its subject matter . \\nvan peebles , a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france , built \" sweet sweetback \" from the ground up almost entirely by himself . \\nbecause no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself . \\nthe movie ended up costing about $500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby . \\nvan peebles cut costs by hiring non-union labor and taking on most of the film\\'s responsibilities himself . \\nhe wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role . \\nhe was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck . \\nfor instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x-rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases \" rated x by an all-white jury , \" which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film . \\nhe also printed the phrase on tee-shirts which he had no problem selling . \\nthe storyline in \" sweet sweetback \" is deceptively simple . \\nit takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex . \\none day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they\\'re bringing in suspects on a politically-charged case involving murder . \\nhowever , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu-mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously . \\nacting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death . \\nthe rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico . \\nalthough the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles\\' camera to roam the darker side of l . a . - the ghettos , alleys , and back-street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked . \\nvan peebles\\' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored . \\nat the beginning of \" sweet sweetback , \" he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : \" sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality . . . \" \\nvan peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration . \\nof course , with today\\'s abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner-city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , \" sweet sweetback \" doesn\\'t seem all that revolutionary . \\nit is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made . \\nat that time , \" sweet sweetback \" was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it . \\ndistributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles\\' words , gave the black audience \" a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass . \" \\nof course , once it caught on , it caught on big . \\n \" sweet sweetback \" is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates \" sweetback \" from other movies like \" shaft \" ( 1972 ) and \" the mack \" ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios . \\n \" sweet sweetback \" is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers . \\nhowever , even if when viewed from an african-american perspective , \" sweet sweetback \" is certainly not without its controversies . \\nwhen it was first released , an article was published in \" ebony \" magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it . \\nthere have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of . \\nothers have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives . \\nstill others point to the clich ? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm . \\nnevertheless , a movie like \" sweet sweetback \" cannot be made without conflicting points of view . \\nit is a revolutionary movie not because it\\'s about one man\\'s defiance , but because it put front-and-center black issues that had never been dealt with before . \\nuntil that point , american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain , and with the exception of sidney poitier , all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites . \\nthe fact that \" sweet sweetback \" was a movie by black about blacks , was something new ( in the opening credits , van peebles lists the starring actors as simply \" the black community \" ) . \\nvan peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between \" sweet sweetback \" and all movies that had come before it . \\nwhen the movie first opened , he saw it in a theater next to an older woman . \\nnear the end of the film , when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert , she kept saying to herself , \" oh lord , let him die . \\ndon\\'t let them kill him . \\nlet him die on his own . \" \\nit was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african-american in a movie who rebelled against white authority , that she couldn\\'t even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape . \\nand , of course , sweetback does escape , and the screen fills with the message : \" watch out ! \\na baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues . \" \\nbeyond the political aspects , \" sweet sweetback \" is an entertaining picture , which van peebles always intended it to be . \\nhe squeezed every drop out of his limited budget , and produced a film that , although dated now , was technically fantastic at the time . \\nhe shot in rough , documentary-like fashion , while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him . \\nhe makes good use of older techniques like split screens , freeze frames , reversed color schemes , and overlapping images . \\nthe only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences , because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment . \\nwatching \" sweet sweetback \" more than twenty-five years after its initial release , one realizes that it still has bite . \\narguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies , but there are still problems that are reflected in this film . \\nbut there is more to the film than its racial aspect . \\nthe legacy of \" sweet sweetback\\'s baadasssss song \" is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african-american perspective , but more importantly , the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him . \\n',\n",
       " b'in december of 1996 , a little movie called \" scream , \" was released , became a box-office smash , and resurrected films targeted at teens . \\nfirst , it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad ( both \" scream \" movies , \" i know what you did last summer , \" \" urban legend , \" etc . ) , but just recently , the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre ( a \\'la \\'80s john hughes ) , starting with last june\\'s \" can\\'t hardly wait . \" \\nit may be the first week of april in 1999 , but so far this year we have been given a movie aimed at the 25-and-under market almost every single week : \" varsity blues , \" \" jawbreaker , \" \" cruel intentions , \" \" simply irresistible , \" \" the rage : carrie 2 , \" and \" the mod squad . \" \\ncoming april 9 are two more of this type : \" never been kissed \" and \" go , \" and on april 23 , we\\'ve got the teen satire \" election \" and the teen horror-comedy \" idle hands . \" \\njeesh ! \\nout of all of these moves , however , the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation , \" 10 things i hate about you , \" is this past january\\'s mediocre , ho-hum \" she\\'s all that . \" \\nalthough similar in plotting ( ok , darn near identical ) , \" 10 things i hate about you , \" a modern-day version of shakespeare\\'s \" the taming of the shrew \" ( \" she\\'s all that \" got its inspiration from \" pygmalion \" ) , is an infinitely superior film in every department , from the smart direction by first-time feature director gil junger to the charming and well-written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast , who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy since 1985\\'s \" the breakfast club . \" \\nand to top it all off , in the inevitable climax set at the prom , at least we didn\\'t have to once again suffer through a goofy , inappropriate dance sequence ( who could forget , or want to remember , for that matter , this ludicrous development in \" she\\'s all that ? \" ) . \\nthe day wide-eyed , shy new student cameron james ( joseph gordon-levitt ) starts school at seattle-based padua high , he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore , bianca stratford ( larisa oleynik ) . \\nalthough he doesn\\'t know french , he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her , but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father ( larry miller ) won\\'t allow her to date until her bitter , unconventional older sister , kat ( julia stiles ) , a senior , decides to . \\nkat , of course , has sworn off the likes of boys , but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her , which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . \\ncomplicating matters , cameron\\'s dorky friend , michael ( david krumholtz ) , decides to use a wealthy jock , joey ( andrew keegan ) , who also has his sights set on bianca , as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him , and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey . \\nas you can see , \" 10 things i hate about you \" includes a huge number of characters , some of which i haven\\'t even mentioned , such as kat\\'s shakespeare-obsessed friend , mandella ( susan may pratt ) and bianca\\'s materialistic comrade , chastity ( gabrielle union ) . \\nat a short , but well-used running time of 98 minutes , all of the characters are perfectly handled , satisfyingly developed , and , for the most part , are not treated as caricatures ( another flaw of \" she\\'s all that , \" where the bad guys ( and gals ) ran around constantly saying , \" you\\'re vapor \" ) . \\nsince i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters , and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective , i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained . \\naside from a good screenplay , it\\'s the performances that can make or break a movie , and director junger has really hit the jackpot . \\naside from joseph gordon-levitt ( \" 3rd rock from the sun \" ) , who gives his strongest performance to date here , none of the actors are that well-known , but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings . \\nas the main character of kat , julia stiles ( last seen in the miniseries \" the \\'60s \" ) is marvelous and always believable , and certainly has a bright future ahead of her . \\neven though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard-edged , it was easy to identify with kat\\'s way of thinking ( she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath ) , and i completely admired her individuality . \\nno one , i think , could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does . \\nheath ledger , as the infamous bad-boy of the town , injects much life into patrick , and has a lot of chemistry with stiles . \\none other actor of note is larisa oleynik who , with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith , is able to turn bianca into a person with multi-dimensions , even though she is accurately self-centered at the on-set . \\nin one truthful scene , cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish , and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes , she has . \\none off-beat element of the film , and a source of some hearty laughs , is the way that the school\\'s staff act , which is strikingly unformal . \\nallison janney , as the guidance counselor ms . perky , who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel , is comic dynamite , as is daryl \" chill \" mitchell as the english teacher , who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and , at one point , sends kat to the office because , for once , she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good . \\nalthough there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning , most of it actually works , especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters . \\nin one very funny scene , chastity asks , \" i know people can be overwhelmed , and they can be underwhelmed , but can people just be . . . whelmed ? \" \\nat another point , bianca and kat\\'s father ( a stand-out larry miller ) , who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant , only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion : before she leaves , she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it\\'s like to be pregnant . \\n \" 10 things i hate about you \" once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre , and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the \\'90s . \\nit also helps that the movie has a perfectly-assembled soundtrack , mixing indie-rock with new wave \\'80s songs ( and with , thank goodness , no rap ) . \\nby the film\\'s end , it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together , and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up , especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca , kat and her father , and a flawlessly-acted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class ( this is where the title comes from ) . \\nluckily , i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hate about \" 10 things i hate about you , \" but the positive aspects of the film far out-number ten . \\n',\n",
       " b'these days , we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old , cult tv shows . \\nmost of the times , the fans of these shows shudder thinking what could hollywood hacks of the present do with the memories of their past . \\nbut , some five or six years ago , there weren\\'t that many movies and the trend didn\\'t look that depressing . \\nso , the people who , like the author of this review , grew up watching flintstones , popular 1960s animated series about \" modern stone age \" family , weren\\'t particularly worried when the word came about live action remake . \\nafter all , the producer behind the project was steven spielberg and , if anything else , at least the special effects would be good . \\nthe plot revolves about flintstones , family set in fictious stone age \" town \" of bedrock , whose members enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle class america . \\nfred flinstone ( john goodman ) works in the quarry , and one day he helps his best friend and neighbour barney rubble ( rick moranis ) and his wife betty ( rosie o\\'donnell ) to adopt a baby . \\nto return the favour , barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred , and , based on that , fred gets well-paid job in management . \\nbut , of course , this is just a sham - corrupt official cliff vandercave ( kyle maclachlan ) and his sultry secretary sharon stone ( halle berry ) need a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme . \\nin the meantime , fred\\'s wife wilma ( elizabeth perkins ) must face her mother ( elizabeth taylor ) who can\\'t stand fred . \\non the superficial level , the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series to life . \\ncomputer effects are flawless , and the costumes , settings and other details are authentic for all the fans of the show . \\nunfortunately , problems with this film start with inadequate casting - rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney , while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie o\\'donnell . \\nbut the greatest problem of all is plot , or to be precise , the lack of plot . \\nsome thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame , original characters one-dimensional , and many elements of the story , like embezzlement and inter-office politics , totally incomprehensible for the little children , the main targeted audience of this film . \\nresult is almost unwatchable mess , occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting ( elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma ) and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as \" high concept \" . \\nafter great hype , movie quickly sank into oblivion and the fans of the show returned to the animated version . \\nall in all , film isn\\'t that bad , but only the hard core fans and nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it . \\n',\n",
